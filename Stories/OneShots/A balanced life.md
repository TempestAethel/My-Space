# The Balancing Act

### **The Story of Clara and the Broken Garden**

Clara was a woman who had always been ambitious. Ever since she could remember, she took pride in never giving up. If it was broken, she would fix it. If it was hard to do, she pushed through. She was convinced that if she tried enough, everything could be accomplished. For a long time, this served her well.

One spring, Clara decided to turn her backyard into a beautiful garden. She imagined flowers of all colors, vines climbing the fence, and the soft hum of bees busy at work. Yet when she began planting, problems surfaced. The soil was rocky, the weather unpredictable, and pests seemed to invade her garden every other week.

Despite this, Clara never once lost her spirit. Every morning, she was out in the garden pulling weeds, adjusting the soil, and fighting insects. She bought special fertilizers, followed the books on gardening, and hired an expert to come and give advice. Every step of the way seemed like a battle uphill, but she always thought it would pay off with persistence.

However, weeks turned into months, and despite her tireless efforts, the garden wasn’t growing as she had hoped. Some plants withered, others were overtaken by weeds, and the flowers she had dreamed of never quite bloomed. Clara felt discouraged but told herself, *"I can’t give up now. Not when I’ve come this far."* She kept working, day after day, each effort more exhausting than the last.

Then one afternoon, Clara's friend Maya arrived to visit. She saw Clara's frustration and the condition of the garden. She went over to her and said, "Clara, you have really put in a lot of effort. But don't you think maybe it is time to step back and reassess? Perhaps there is another way to do it."

Clara flared up in defense. "I can't quit now, Maya. Not after everything that has gone on. If I quit now, it's all going to go to waste."

Maya smiled consolingly. "I am not telling you to quit completely. Sometimes the most important thing is to know when to step back. Balance is the word, Clara."

Clara furrowed her face. She was unclear about what Maya meant, but the idea just dangled there in her head.

In the evening, Clara sat on her porch looking out towards her garden. She just couldn't shake the nagging thought that perhaps Maya was right. Perseveration isn't always the answer, perhaps it is just fine to let go, to quit trying at something that isn't working. The garden just wasn't growing and, regardless of all the time she had put in, was going nowhere towards becoming that peaceful sanctuary she envisioned.

She closed her eyes, recalled all the times she had overdone things before—times she had refused to let go only to emerge late at night drained, exhausted, burned out, and resentful. This wasn't easy for Clara, but perhaps this garden needed something else: rest, breathing space, or even a turn in direction. Perhaps it wasn't about pushing but embracing patience and reflection.

The next morning, Clara, determined to visit the local garden center—not to buy any more fertilizers or tools but perhaps some professional advice—got there and sought help. She told the gardener this story, and he listened carefully, then something in his calm voice caught her attention: "Sometimes it is not about pushing harder. Sometimes, it's about giving the earth time to recover. You might want to give the soil a break and let it heal before you plant again."

Clara then realized that it wasn't about forcing the garden to grow but actually knowing when to let go. So Clara did the opposite. She took out the broken plants, spread some compost to enrich the soil, and let the garden rest over the next couple of weeks.
.

But not every situation required letting go. Clara still believed in persistence, and sometimes it was appropriate to push forward.

A few months later, Clara was tasked with a difficult project at work. It was a new initiative that required long hours, complex problem-solving, and relentless effort. The team was facing challenges, and Clara could see that some of her colleagues were ready to give up. They wanted to quit the project; convinced, as they were that they had hit an impenetrable wall. But Clara remembered her experiences with the garden-the balance. She knew that sometimes, the only way was to **hold on**, even when things seemed black.

She got the crew together and said, "We have had our challenges, but I feel that we can work through it. Hold on for just a little longer-we can make it work. Let's push a bit more."

That motivated her; she has taught them what they need to be motivated. She, along with all of them, debated and finally discovered better solutions than before. Their persistence really paid off since the project came off very successfully. Then Clara realized that sometimes, under right circumstances, persistence was a necessity rather than an option.

### The Balance

And with every year that went by, Clara's garden bloomed, not as she used to envision it but here, a lesson on not forcing every plant up to shape according to the imaginary form in one's head but instead when not to hold on and give the garden room to breathe and heal.

And in her work, she realized that persistence, when applied thoughtfully, can break even through the hardest challenges. Again, though, it's a balance: too much persistence without reflection leads to burnout; too much letting go may mean missed opportunities.

Clara learned that the difference between life and death was not the mere ability to keep pushing through or yielding at the very slightest hint of difficulty—but knowing when to push forward with all of one's strength, and when to yield and wait for the right moment to act.

### **The Lesson**

Balance, Clara realized, wasn't only an idea-it was a practice. Life required both persistence and patience, both hard work and the wisdom to know when to rest. A feat in her garden and at work, she found that what made for peace and success was recognizing the moments where in she should push forward and where she needed to pull back. And with this, she found deeper fulfillment in her life.

Sometimes, it's better to keep going. Sometimes, it's better to quit. And sometimes, it's about knowing the difference.
