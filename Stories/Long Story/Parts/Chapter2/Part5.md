## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The morning after the art showcase, Ethan woke with an odd mix of emotions swirling in his chest. Maya’s painting had stayed with him, its colors and energy replaying in his mind like a vivid dream.  

It wasn’t just the painting, though. It was her—the way she’d lit up when talking about her work, the quiet pride in her eyes as people admired it. It was the realization that her world was bigger, brighter, and so much more expansive than his own.  

He wanted to tell her how much it all meant to him, how much *she* meant to him. But as always, the words felt too big, too complicated.

That afternoon, they met at their usual coffee shop, but the mood felt different. Maya was quieter than usual, her sketchbook lying unopened on the table. Ethan watched her, his own coffee growing cold as he tried to read the expression on her face.  

“Everything okay?” he asked finally, his voice breaking the silence.  

Maya looked up, startled, as if she’d forgotten he was there. “Yeah,” she said, forcing a smile. “Just thinking.”  

“About what?”  

She hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her cup. “About the future,” she said softly. “About what happens after all of this.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “You mean after graduation?”  

Maya nodded, her gaze dropping to the table. “I don’t want to lose this,” she said, echoing the words he’d spoken just days before. “But I also know things are going to change. They have to.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the knot in his chest tightening. “We’ll figure it out,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt.  

Maya looked at him, her eyes searching his. “Will we?”  

“Yes,” he said firmly. “We will.”  

For a moment, they just stared at each other, the weight of the unspoken lingering between them. Then Maya smiled—small, tentative, but real.  

“Okay,” she said.  

And just like that, the tension began to ease.

Later, as they walked across campus, Maya looped her arm through Ethan’s, leaning against him as they strolled.  

“Do you think it’s silly?” she asked suddenly.  

“Do I think what’s silly?”  

“My dream,” she said, glancing up at him. “To travel, to paint the world. Sometimes it feels so… impractical.”  

Ethan stopped, turning to face her. “It’s not silly,” he said, his voice firm. “It’s brave. And it’s beautiful.”  

Maya blinked, her cheeks flushing. “You really think so?”  

“I do,” Ethan said. “And I think you’ll make it happen, no matter what.”  

Her smile was brighter this time, and she squeezed his arm. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”  

As they continued walking, Ethan couldn’t help but feel a quiet sense of certainty settling over him. Whatever challenges lay ahead, he knew one thing for sure: he wanted to be there for her, every step of the way.
