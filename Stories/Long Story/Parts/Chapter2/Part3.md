## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The next morning, Ethan found himself waiting outside Maya’s studio. It wasn’t their usual meeting spot, but after last night, he felt drawn to her space in a way he hadn’t before.  

When she opened the door, her face lit up in surprise. “Ethan? You’re early. Didn’t think I’d see you before our coffee shop run.”  

He shrugged, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Figured I’d come to you for a change.”  

Maya stepped aside, waving him in. “Well, come on, then. I was just finishing something.”  

The studio was as chaotic as ever—paint-splattered canvases leaning against the walls, jars of brushes in various states of use, and the faint scent of turpentine hanging in the air. Ethan didn’t mind the mess; it felt like an extension of Maya herself.  

“So,” she said, picking up a half-finished canvas, “what brings you here? Looking for another art lesson?”  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “Not today. I just wanted to see what you’ve been working on.”  

Maya tilted her head, studying him for a moment before setting the canvas on her easel. “Alright,” she said, stepping back. “What do you think?”  

The painting was bold and vibrant, a swirling mix of colors that seemed to pulse with energy. It was different from her usual work—less structured, more raw.  

“It’s incredible,” Ethan said, his voice sincere.  

Maya smiled, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thanks. I’ve been experimenting with something new. Trying to figure out where I want to go next.”  

Ethan frowned, sensing the weight in her words. “What do you mean?”  

She sighed, crossing her arms. “I love it here—this studio, this campus, the life I’ve built. But sometimes I feel like I’m standing still, like I’m waiting for something to happen instead of making it happen.”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to respond. “You’re doing amazing things, Maya. Anyone can see that.”  

Maya gave him a small smile. “Thanks, but it’s not just about doing. It’s about feeling like I’m moving forward, you know? Like I’m chasing something bigger.”  

Ethan nodded slowly, her words stirring something in him. He’d always admired her drive, but hearing her doubts made her feel even more real—like she wasn’t just a force of nature but someone grappling with her own uncertainties.  

“What about you?” Maya asked suddenly, turning to face him. “What are you chasing?”  

Ethan blinked, caught off guard. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve always just… followed the plan. School, work, stability. But lately, I’ve been wondering if there’s more to it than that.”  

Maya smiled softly, stepping closer. “There is. You just have to figure out what it looks like for you.”  

The simplicity of her words hit him harder than he expected. He didn’t have an answer yet, but for the first time, he felt like he wanted to start searching.

That afternoon, they skipped the coffee shop and stayed in the studio, talking and painting until the sun dipped below the horizon. Ethan’s hands were a mess of colors, his shirt streaked with paint, but he didn’t care.  

As they cleaned up, Maya handed him a small canvas—a simple, abstract piece she’d finished while they talked.  

“What’s this?” he asked, holding it carefully.  

“Just something to remind you,” she said, her smile warm.  

“Of what?”  

“That there’s no wrong way to figure things out,” she said. “And that you don’t have to do it alone.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened, and for a moment, he couldn’t find the words to respond. Instead, he nodded, tucking the canvas under his arm as they walked out into the cool evening air.  

For the first time, he felt like the future didn’t have to be something to fear. With Maya by his side, it felt like it could be something to look forward to.
