## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The days began to blur into a rhythm Ethan hadn’t realized he needed. Mornings were spent in class or at his desk, afternoons at the coffee shop with Maya, and evenings often spilled into her studio, where they talked, painted, or simply existed in each other’s presence.  

But the closer they grew, the more Ethan felt the quiet tug of uncertainty pulling at the edges of his thoughts.  

One evening, as they sat on the floor of Maya’s studio, surrounded by half-finished canvases and the soft glow of string lights, Ethan broke the comfortable silence.  

“Do you ever think about what it’ll be like when we’re not here anymore?” he asked, his voice tentative.  

Maya glanced at him, her brow furrowing. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean… after we graduate,” he said, staring down at the brush in his hand. “When we’re not meeting at the coffee shop every day or hanging out here. What happens then?”  

Maya was quiet for a moment, her expression thoughtful. “I guess I haven’t really thought about it,” she admitted. “But I like to think we’ll figure it out. You know, if it matters enough.”  

Ethan looked up at her, his chest tightening. “What if it’s not that simple?”  

Maya’s lips curved into a small, wistful smile. “It never is,” she said softly. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying.”  

Her words hung in the air, heavy with meaning, and Ethan felt the familiar weight of everything he wasn’t saying pressing down on him.  

“I don’t want to lose this,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya’s gaze softened, and she reached out, her fingers brushing against his. “You won’t,” she said firmly. “Not if we don’t let it happen.”  

Ethan nodded, though the knot in his chest didn’t fully ease.

The following week, Maya invited Ethan to one of her art showcases—a small gallery on campus where students displayed their work.  

The room was filled with bright, chaotic pieces, each one a reflection of the artist who’d created it. Ethan wandered through the space, taking it all in, but his attention kept drifting back to the painting Maya had entered: a swirling, vibrant canvas that seemed to pulse with life.  

“That’s yours, isn’t it?” he asked when she came to stand beside him.  

Maya smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Yeah. What do you think?”  

“It’s incredible,” Ethan said, his voice filled with awe. “It’s… you.”  

Maya blinked, her cheeks flushing slightly. “You think so?”  

He nodded, his gaze never leaving the painting. “It’s everything you are—bold, alive, full of possibility.”  

For a moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of his words settling between them. Then, Maya turned to him, her eyes shimmering with something Ethan couldn’t quite name.  

“Thank you,” she said softly.  

Ethan smiled, though his chest felt tight. “You don’t have to thank me. I’m just telling the truth.”

Later that night, as they walked back across campus, Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted between them.  

Maya had always been a force of nature, but seeing her in the gallery, surrounded by the world she’d created, made him realize just how far apart their dreams might take them.  

And yet, as she looped her arm through his and leaned her head against his shoulder, Ethan couldn’t help but feel like, for now, this was enough.  

Whatever the future held, he wasn’t ready to let go.
