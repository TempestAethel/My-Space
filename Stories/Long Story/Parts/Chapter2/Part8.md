## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

As winter crept closer, the days grew shorter, and the time Ethan and Maya spent together felt more precious. The routines they’d built—afternoons at the coffee shop, evenings in the studio—became an anchor for Ethan, a constant he found himself clinging to.  

But as much as he cherished their moments, he couldn’t ignore the quiet questions that lingered in the back of his mind. What would happen when the semester ended? When graduation loomed closer, and life began pulling them in different directions?  

He hadn’t voiced those fears yet, and neither had Maya. But some nights, when the studio was quiet, and the only sound was the scratch of her pencil against paper, Ethan wondered if she was thinking the same thing.

One evening, as they walked across campus, Maya slowed her pace, glancing up at the sky.  

“Do you ever feel like time moves too fast?” she asked, her voice soft.  

Ethan glanced at her, surprised. “All the time.”  

Maya smiled faintly, her gaze distant. “I don’t want to look back and feel like I missed something important, you know? Like I didn’t make the most of it.”  

“You’re not missing anything,” Ethan said, his voice steady. “If anything, you’re the one teaching the rest of us how to live in the moment.”  

Maya laughed lightly, though there was a wistfulness to it. “Sometimes I think I’m just pretending,” she admitted. “Like I’m trying so hard to soak it all in because I’m scared of what comes next.”  

Ethan stopped walking, turning to face her. “You don’t have to figure it all out right now,” he said. “You’re allowed to just… be.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes softening. “You always know the right thing to say,” she said quietly.  

Ethan’s chest tightened, and for a moment, he thought about telling her everything—how much she meant to him, how terrified he was of losing her. But the words caught in his throat, and the moment passed.

Later that night, as they sat in her studio, Maya pulled out a small, wrapped package and handed it to him.  

“What’s this?” Ethan asked, his brow furrowing.  

“An early Christmas present,” Maya said, grinning. “Go on, open it.”  

Ethan hesitated, then carefully tore the wrapping paper to reveal a hardcover journal. The cover was a deep navy blue, and his name was embossed in gold lettering on the front.  

“I figured you needed a place to keep all your ideas,” Maya said, her smile soft.  

Ethan stared at the journal, his chest tightening. “Maya, this is…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “Thank you. Really.”  

“You’re welcome,” she said, nudging him playfully. “Just promise me you’ll actually use it.”  

Ethan chuckled, running his fingers over the smooth cover. “I promise.”

That night, as he sat at his desk, Ethan opened the journal and stared at the blank pages.  

He wasn’t sure where to start, but as he picked up his pen, he found himself writing about Maya—about her laughter, her passion, the way she made the world feel bigger and brighter.  

The words came slowly at first, then faster, spilling out in a way that felt almost effortless.  

By the time he set the pen down, the knot in his chest had eased, replaced by a quiet sense of clarity.  

He didn’t know what the future held, but for now, he was certain of one thing: Maya was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
