## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

Winter break was just around the corner, and the campus was beginning to quiet down. Students rushed to finish final projects and prepare for the holidays, but for Ethan, everything outside his time with Maya felt like background noise.  

One evening, as snow flurries swirled in the air, they sat on a bench in the park. The trees were bare, their branches dusted with white, and the world around them felt still and hushed.  

Maya tucked her hands into her coat pockets, her breath forming soft clouds in the cold air. “I love the first snow,” she said, her voice quiet. “It always feels… magical.”  

Ethan glanced at her, his heart catching at the way the snowflakes clung to her hair, the soft glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes.  

“It is,” he said, though he wasn’t sure if he was talking about the snow or her.  

Maya smiled, tilting her head to look at him. “You’ve been quiet tonight. What’s on your mind?”  

Ethan hesitated, his gaze dropping to his hands. “Just… everything,” he admitted. “The semester ending, winter break, what happens after.”  

Maya’s smile faded slightly, and she looked down at the ground. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I’ve been thinking about that too.”  

Ethan exhaled, the knot in his chest tightening. “I don’t want this to change,” he said quietly. “I don’t want us to lose this.”  

Maya reached out, her hand brushing against his. “We won’t,” she said firmly. “No matter what, Ethan. We’ll figure it out.”  

Her words brought a small measure of comfort, but the uncertainty lingered. Ethan wanted to believe her, but a part of him couldn’t help but worry about the things they couldn’t control.

A few days later, they met in Maya’s studio for what had become their usual evening routine. The room was warm and inviting, the faint hum of music in the background and the soft glow of string lights casting a cozy atmosphere.  

Maya was working on a new painting, her brush moving in quick, confident strokes. Ethan sat nearby, his journal open in his lap, though he hadn’t written much.  

“What’s that one about?” he asked, nodding toward her canvas.  

Maya paused, glancing over her shoulder at him. “It’s… complicated,” she said with a small smile. “Kind of like how I’ve been feeling lately. A little all over the place.”  

Ethan nodded, understanding more than he let on. “It’s beautiful,” he said softly.  

Maya’s smile widened, and she turned back to her work. “Thanks. I’m not sure if it’ll ever feel finished, though.”  

“Maybe it doesn’t have to be,” Ethan said, surprising himself with the thought. “Maybe some things are meant to stay open, like they’re still growing.”  

Maya stopped, her brush hovering over the canvas. She turned to look at him, her expression thoughtful. “You know, sometimes I forget how wise you are,” she said, her voice teasing but warm.  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “I think you give me too much credit.”  

Maya set her brush down and crossed the room to sit beside him. “No, I don’t,” she said, her tone serious now. “You see things in a way most people don’t, Ethan. And I think you underestimate how much that matters.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I don’t know what I’d do without you,” he said quietly.  

Maya’s eyes softened, and she reached out to take his hand. “You won’t have to find out,” she said simply.  

In that moment, with her hand in his and the quiet warmth of her words wrapping around him, Ethan felt like maybe—just maybe—they could hold on to this, no matter what the future brought.
