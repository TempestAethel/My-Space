## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The following weeks were a blur of deadlines and late nights. Ethan threw himself into his coursework, the weight of upcoming exams and project submissions pressing heavily on him. Meanwhile, Maya became a ghost of herself, disappearing for long stretches into the studio.  

When they did manage to meet, their time together felt… different. The easy rhythm they’d shared after the trip seemed harder to hold onto, replaced by a quiet tension that neither of them wanted to name.

One evening, Ethan found himself walking to the studio, the familiar ache of missing Maya pushing him to seek her out.  

When he arrived, the room was alive with color. Paintings in various stages of completion covered the walls, their bold, chaotic energy a stark contrast to the quiet focus of Maya herself.  

She didn’t notice him at first, her brush moving quickly across the canvas in front of her. Her hair was pulled into a messy bun, stray streaks of paint marking her hands and cheeks.  

“Maya,” Ethan said softly, not wanting to startle her.  

She looked up, her expression softening when she saw him. “Ethan. Hey.”  

“I figured I’d find you here,” he said, stepping closer.  

Maya smiled faintly, setting her brush down. “Yeah, I’ve been kind of… consumed by this lately. Sorry I’ve been MIA.”  

Ethan shook his head. “It’s okay. I get it. You’re working on something important.”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor. “It’s not just the work,” she admitted. “It’s everything. I feel like I’m trying so hard to hold it all together, but some days… I don’t know if I’m doing enough.”  

Ethan frowned, his chest tightening. “Maya, you’re incredible. The way you put your heart into everything you do—it’s inspiring. You don’t have to be perfect.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes shimmering. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”  

He stepped closer, his voice gentle. “You don’t have to go through this alone, you know. I’m here. Always.”  

For a moment, Maya didn’t say anything. Then she reached out, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug.  

“Thank you,” she whispered.  

Ethan held her close, the weight between them easing slightly.

As they walked back to campus together that night, Maya glanced at him, her expression thoughtful.  

“Do you ever feel like you’re being pulled in two directions?” she asked.  

“All the time,” Ethan admitted.  

Maya nodded, her gaze distant. “I love what I’m doing here, but I can’t help thinking about everything I want to do after. All the places I want to see, all the things I want to create. It’s hard to balance that with… everything else.”  

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts swirling. “It’s not easy,” he said finally. “But I think you’re already doing it. You’re chasing what you love, and that’s what matters.”  

Maya smiled faintly. “What about you? What do you want?”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her question cutting through him like a blade. He’d been so focused on getting through each day, each assignment, that he hadn’t stopped to think about the bigger picture.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But I know I want to figure it out. And I think… I think I want you to be part of that.”  

Maya stopped walking, turning to face him. “Ethan…”  

Her voice was soft, unsure, and for a moment, Ethan thought he might have said too much. But then she smiled, her eyes warm.  

“Me too,” she said.  

Ethan exhaled, the weight in his chest easing.

Later that night, as Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, he thought about Maya’s words—the way she talked about being pulled in two directions, the way her eyes had softened when she said she wanted him to be part of her future.  

It wasn’t a solution, not yet. But it was a step.  

And for now, that was enough.
