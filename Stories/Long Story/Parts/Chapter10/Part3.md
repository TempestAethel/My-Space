## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Continued)

Ethan stared at his phone, his latest message to Maya sitting unread. The minutes stretched into an hour, then two, as the familiar knot of doubt tightened in his chest. He told himself she was probably busy, but the silence felt heavier than it should have.  

He tried to distract himself, flipping through a book he’d been meaning to finish, but the words blurred on the page. Eventually, he gave up, setting the book aside and reaching for his phone again. Still no response.  

This had become a pattern lately—him reaching out, trying to keep the conversation alive, while her replies came slower and shorter. He didn’t know when the shift had started, but it was impossible to ignore.  

The last time they’d met for coffee, Maya had seemed distant, her attention drifting as he spoke. He’d noticed her checking her phone more often, her responses clipped and vague.  

“Everything okay?” he’d asked cautiously.  

“Yeah, just tired,” she’d replied with a quick smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.  

Ethan had let it go at the time, not wanting to press her, but now the memory nagged at him. Was she pulling away, or was he reading too much into it?

Liam’s voice broke through his thoughts later that evening as they walked back from class.  

“You’ve been quiet lately. What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, debating whether to bring it up. “It’s Maya,” he admitted finally. “I feel like she’s slipping away, and I don’t know what to do about it.”  

Liam frowned. “Slipping away how?”  

“She barely texts back, and when she does, it feels… off. Like she’s just going through the motions,” Ethan said, his frustration spilling out. “I’m trying to be there for her, but it’s like no matter what I do, it’s never enough.”  

“Have you talked to her about it?” Liam asked.  

Ethan shook his head. “I don’t want to start a fight. What if I’m overreacting?”  

Liam gave him a pointed look. “And what if you’re not? You’ve been twisting yourself into knots trying to figure this out. Maybe it’s time to stop guessing and just ask her.”  

Ethan sighed, unsure if he was ready for the answer.

Later that night, as he lay in bed, Ethan drafted a message to Maya. He stared at the words for what felt like an eternity, his thumb hovering over the send button.  

**Ethan:** Hey, can we talk sometime? I feel like things have been different lately, and I just want to make sure we’re okay.  

His chest tightened as he finally hit send, the weight of the message settling over him.  

All he could do now was wait.
