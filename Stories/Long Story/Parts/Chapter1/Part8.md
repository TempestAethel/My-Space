## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

The next day, Ethan arrived at the coffee shop earlier than usual. The familiar buzz of conversation filled the air, but for once, it didn’t comfort him. He found himself restless, his mind replaying the previous night’s conversation with Maya.  

“You should come with me.”  

He wanted to believe she’d meant it casually, just another whimsical suggestion from someone who saw the world as an open canvas. But a part of him wondered if there had been more to her words—if she’d been asking him for something he wasn’t ready to give.  

Maya arrived a few minutes later, her sketchbook tucked under one arm and a mischievous smile playing on her lips. “You’re early,” she said, sliding into the seat across from him.  

“Yeah,” Ethan said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I guess I had some extra time.”  

She raised an eyebrow but didn’t press the issue. Instead, she pulled out her sketchbook and flipped to a blank page. “I’ve been thinking,” she said, tapping her pencil against the table. “You should let me draw you.”  

Ethan blinked. “Me?”  

“Yeah, you,” she said, grinning. “You’ve got one of those faces. Kind of serious, but with a lot going on underneath. It’s interesting.”  

Ethan chuckled nervously. “I don’t know about that.”  

“Oh, come on,” she said, leaning forward. “You sit still for hours anyway. It’ll be easy.”  

He hesitated, unsure if he could handle being the subject of her attention for that long. But the way she was looking at him—bright-eyed and expectant—made it impossible to say no.  

“Fine,” he said, sighing. “But if it turns out terrible, I’m blaming you.”  

Maya laughed, already pulling a pencil from her bag. “Deal.”  

As she began to sketch, Ethan tried to focus on his laptop, but it was impossible to ignore the way her eyes flicked up to meet his every few seconds, studying him with an intensity that made his heart race.  

“You don’t have to look so nervous,” she said after a while, her voice light. “I’m not judging you.”  

“I’m not nervous,” Ethan said quickly, though the warmth creeping up his neck betrayed him.  

Maya smirked, clearly unconvinced. “Whatever you say.”  

The minutes stretched on, and slowly, Ethan began to relax. There was something calming about the quiet scratch of her pencil against the paper, the way her brow furrowed in concentration.  

“Done,” she said finally, holding up the sketch with a triumphant smile.  

Ethan leaned forward, his curiosity outweighing his apprehension. The drawing was simple, yet striking—a reflection of himself through her eyes. Somehow, she’d managed to capture more than just his features. There was a softness to it, a depth that made him feel both vulnerable and seen.  

“Wow,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “That’s… amazing.”  

Maya’s smile softened. “Thanks. You’re a pretty good subject, you know.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure what to say to that, so he just nodded, his gaze lingering on the sketch.  

As they packed up their things and prepared to leave, Maya slipped the drawing into her bag without a word. Ethan thought about asking her what she planned to do with it, but something stopped him.  

Instead, they walked out together, the silence between them comfortable but charged with something unspoken.

That night, Ethan found himself staring at his reflection in the mirror, thinking about the version of himself Maya had drawn.  

He didn’t know how she’d done it, but somehow, she’d captured more than just his likeness. She’d captured a piece of him he hadn’t even realized was there—a piece that only seemed to come alive when he was with her.  

And for the first time, Ethan wondered if Maya saw something in him that he’d never seen in himself.
