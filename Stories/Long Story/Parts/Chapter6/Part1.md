## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance  

The days that followed felt heavier for Ethan, each one blending into the next in a dull haze. The routines that had once grounded him now felt hollow, their meaning stripped away by the absence of Maya in his life.  

He found himself avoiding the places they used to go together—the coffee shop, the park, even the quiet corner of the library where they’d often study side by side. Everywhere he went, memories of her seemed to linger, refusing to fade.

Maya, too, struggled to adjust. The studio, which had always been her sanctuary, now felt suffocating. Her paintings lacked the energy they once held, her brushstrokes hesitant and uncertain.  

She threw herself into her work anyway, hoping that the act of creating would quiet the ache in her chest. But no matter how many hours she spent painting, she couldn’t escape the feeling that something was missing.

One evening, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the blank pages of the journal Maya had given him. The weight of his emotions felt too heavy to put into words, but he picked up his pen anyway, letting the thoughts spill out in messy, fragmented sentences.  

“I miss her. I miss the way she made everything feel brighter, lighter. I know we needed this space, but it feels like a part of me is missing. How do you move forward when you’re not sure where you’re going?”  

He set the pen down, closing the journal with a sigh.

A few weeks later, Ethan ran into Maya by chance. It was late in the afternoon, and he was walking across campus when he spotted her coming out of the art building.  

She looked the same—her hair pulled into a loose braid, her bag slung over one shoulder—but there was something different about her. She seemed quieter, more subdued.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice soft as she stopped in front of him.  

“Maya,” he replied, his heart pounding at the sight of her.  

They stood there for a moment, an awkward silence stretching between them.  

“How have you been?” Maya asked finally.  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. “I’ve been… okay,” he said. “What about you?”  

Maya smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Same.”  

Another silence fell between them, and Ethan felt the weight of all the things he wanted to say pressing down on him.  

“I miss you,” he said suddenly, the words tumbling out before he could stop them.  

Maya’s eyes widened slightly, and for a moment, he thought she might say it back. But instead, she looked down, her expression pained.  

“I miss you too,” she said quietly. “But…”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “But what?”  

Maya met his gaze, her eyes filled with sadness. “I don’t know if we’re ready to go back to the way things were. Not yet.”  

Ethan nodded slowly, though her words felt like a punch to the gut. “I get it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya smiled faintly, her eyes glistening. “I hope you do.”  

With that, she turned and walked away, leaving Ethan standing there, the ache in his chest deeper than ever.

That night, Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Her words echoed in his mind, and though they brought no clarity, they stirred a small, fragile hope.  

Maybe they weren’t ready yet.  

But maybe, someday, they would be.
