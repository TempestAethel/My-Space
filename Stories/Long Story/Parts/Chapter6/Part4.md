## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)

Ethan sat alone in the library, his notes spread out in front of him but untouched. He tapped his pen against the notebook, the soft rhythm failing to distract him from the thought that had been haunting him for days. Maya had started texting again.

At first, it was small things—questions about their shared class or a passing comment about the campus coffee shop. But as the days went on, the messages became more personal.  

**Maya:** Saw a couple hiking today. Made me think of our trip.  

Ethan had stared at his phone for a long time after reading that one. He could feel the weight of her words, the longing hidden between the lines. But he didn’t reply. He didn’t trust himself to.

Maya wasn’t one to give up easily, though. One afternoon, she waited outside the library, leaning against the stone wall with her arms crossed. When Ethan stepped outside, their eyes met.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

Ethan stopped in his tracks. “Maya,” he replied, his voice careful, guarded.  

“Can we talk?” she asked.  

He hesitated, torn between the pull of her presence and the resolve he’d been working so hard to maintain. “I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he said finally.  

Maya’s brow furrowed, but she didn’t look away. “Why not?”  

“Because we’ve been here before,” Ethan said, his voice low. “And it doesn’t end well. For either of us.”

The words hung heavy between them, the space filled with unspoken emotions. Maya stepped closer, her expression earnest. “Ethan, I know things haven’t been perfect. But I miss you. I miss us.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I miss you too,” he admitted. “But missing each other isn’t enough. We keep hurting each other, Maya. And I don’t know how to fix that.”  

Maya’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, and she bit her lip, trying to find the right words. “I don’t want to lose you,” she whispered.  

“You’re not losing me,” Ethan said, his voice soft but firm. “We just… need to figure out who we are on our own first. Otherwise, we’ll keep falling into the same patterns.”

Maya nodded slowly, though the sadness in her eyes didn’t fade. “I get it,” she said. “I don’t like it, but I get it.”  

Ethan smiled faintly, a bittersweet ache settling in his chest. “I care about you, Maya. I always will. But right now, I think we need to let go so we can grow.”  

Maya blinked back tears, her lips pressing into a thin line as she fought to keep her composure. “You’re braver than I am,” she said after a moment.  

Ethan shook his head. “I’m just trying to do what’s right. For both of us.”

As Maya walked away, Ethan felt the familiar pang of longing, but he forced himself to stay rooted in the present. This wasn’t easy—it was one of the hardest things he’d ever done. But deep down, he knew it was necessary.

And as he turned back toward the library, he made a silent promise to himself: to keep moving forward, even when it hurt. Because sometimes, letting go was the only way to truly hold on—to hope, to growth, to the possibility of something better.
