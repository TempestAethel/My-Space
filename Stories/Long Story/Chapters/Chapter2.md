# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds  

The days that followed felt like a dream Ethan didn’t want to wake up from.  

For so long, he’d tried to keep his feelings for Maya buried, convinced that admitting them would break whatever fragile connection they’d built. But now that the truth was out, everything felt… lighter. Easier.  

They still met at the coffee shop every day, still spent hours talking about everything and nothing. But there was a new closeness between them—a quiet understanding that made each moment feel more meaningful.  

“Okay,” Maya said one afternoon, setting her sketchbook aside with a flourish. “I’ve decided.”  

Ethan raised an eyebrow, glancing up from his laptop. “Decided what?”  

“That you need to let me teach you something creative,” she said, grinning.  

He chuckled, shaking his head. “Maya, I’m the least creative person you’ve ever met.”  

“Exactly,” she said, leaning forward. “Which is why you need me. Come on, it’ll be fun. You can’t spend your whole life staring at spreadsheets and blueprints.”  

Ethan hesitated, but the look in her eyes made it impossible to say no. “Fine,” he said, sighing dramatically. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”  

---

Later that evening, they sat cross-legged on the floor of Maya’s studio, surrounded by blank canvases and scattered paint tubes.  

“Okay,” Maya said, handing him a brush. “Rule number one: don’t overthink it. Just let it flow.”  

Ethan stared at the brush like it was a foreign object. “Let it flow? That’s not really how my brain works.”  

Maya laughed, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “Relax, Ethan. It’s just paint. There’s no right or wrong here.”  

He exhaled slowly, dipping the brush into a blob of blue paint. Tentatively, he dragged it across the canvas, leaving a shaky streak in its wake.  

“See?” Maya said, smiling. “You’re a natural.”  

Ethan snorted. “I doubt that.”  

“Hey,” she said, nudging him gently. “This isn’t about being good. It’s about expressing yourself. Just… think about how you’re feeling and let the colors do the talking.”  

Ethan frowned, glancing at the canvas again. He wasn’t sure how to express himself with colors, but as he dipped the brush into a vibrant red, something inside him loosened.  

Minutes turned into hours as they painted side by side, the room filled with laughter and the quiet hum of creativity. Ethan’s strokes grew bolder, more confident, and by the time they finished, his canvas was a chaotic swirl of colors that somehow felt right.  

“Not bad,” Maya said, tilting her head as she studied his work. “Definitely abstract.”  

Ethan chuckled, wiping a smudge of paint from his cheek. “You’re just being nice.”  

“No, really,” she said, her eyes sparkling. “It’s you. Messy, thoughtful, a little chaotic—but it works.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, a warmth spreading through him. “Thanks,” he said quietly.  

Maya smiled, reaching out to brush a streak of paint from his arm. “See? Told you this would be fun.”  

And for the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he’d stepped out of his comfort zone—and found something worth holding onto.  

---

As they cleaned up, Ethan glanced at Maya, his heart full in a way he couldn’t quite explain.  

“You were right,” he said, his voice soft.  

“About what?”  

“About needing this,” he admitted. “About needing you.”  

Maya paused, meeting his gaze. For a moment, neither of them said anything, the weight of his words hanging in the air. Then she smiled—a small, genuine smile that made his chest ache in the best way.  

“Well,” she said, her voice light but warm, “I guess that makes us even.”  

--- 

The next week passed in a blur of late nights, laughter, and quiet moments that lingered long after they ended. Ethan found himself craving Maya’s presence more and more, drawn to the way she brought color to his otherwise black-and-white world.  

It wasn’t just her creativity that captivated him—it was her energy, the way she saw beauty in everything and carried herself like the world was full of endless possibilities.  

But with every passing day, a quiet fear grew in the back of Ethan’s mind. What if this was temporary? What if it all came crashing down the moment their lives shifted, as he knew they inevitably would?  

He didn’t bring it up, though. For now, he just wanted to hold on to this—whatever “this” was—for as long as he could.  

---

One evening, as they sat on a bench in the campus park, Maya leaned back, staring up at the stars.  

“You ever wonder what’s out there?” she asked, her voice soft.  

Ethan glanced at her, his brow furrowing. “Out where?”  

“Out there,” she said, gesturing toward the sky. “In the universe. In the places we can’t see.”  

Ethan followed her gaze, the faint glimmer of stars reflected in her eyes. “I guess I’ve never really thought about it,” he admitted.  

Maya smiled faintly, hugging her knees to her chest. “I think about it all the time. How big everything is. How small we are. It’s kind of overwhelming, but also… comforting.”  

“Comforting?” Ethan asked, glancing at her.  

“Yeah,” she said, nodding. “It reminds me that no matter how big our problems feel, they’re just a tiny piece of something so much bigger. It makes it easier to let go.”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her words sinking in. He’d never been good at letting go. His whole life had been about control—about planning, solving, and making sure everything stayed on track.  

But with Maya, things didn’t feel so rigid. They didn’t have to.  

“I think you’re a lot braver than me,” he said finally, his voice quiet.  

Maya turned to him, her expression soft. “Why do you say that?”  

“Because you’re not afraid to just… be,” he said. “To let things happen. I don’t know how to do that.”  

Maya smiled, her eyes warm. “It’s not about being brave, Ethan. It’s about trusting that things will work out, even if you don’t know how. And you don’t have to figure it all out alone, you know.”  

The sincerity in her voice caught him off guard, and for a moment, he couldn’t look away.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya reached out, her fingers brushing against his in a small, fleeting gesture. “You’re welcome,” she said, her smile returning.  

They sat in silence after that, the cool night air wrapping around them as the stars blinked overhead. For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he could breathe—like maybe, just maybe, things didn’t have to be so complicated.  

---

Later that night, as Ethan walked back to his dorm, he found himself smiling for no reason at all.  

Maya had a way of making the world feel bigger and smaller at the same time—like anything was possible, but also like the only thing that mattered was the moment they were in.  

He didn’t know where this was all heading, and for once, he didn’t care. All he knew was that he wanted to keep walking this path with her, wherever it led.  

--- 

The next morning, Ethan found himself waiting outside Maya’s studio. It wasn’t their usual meeting spot, but after last night, he felt drawn to her space in a way he hadn’t before.  

When she opened the door, her face lit up in surprise. “Ethan? You’re early. Didn’t think I’d see you before our coffee shop run.”  

He shrugged, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Figured I’d come to you for a change.”  

Maya stepped aside, waving him in. “Well, come on, then. I was just finishing something.”  

The studio was as chaotic as ever—paint-splattered canvases leaning against the walls, jars of brushes in various states of use, and the faint scent of turpentine hanging in the air. Ethan didn’t mind the mess; it felt like an extension of Maya herself.  

“So,” she said, picking up a half-finished canvas, “what brings you here? Looking for another art lesson?”  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “Not today. I just wanted to see what you’ve been working on.”  

Maya tilted her head, studying him for a moment before setting the canvas on her easel. “Alright,” she said, stepping back. “What do you think?”  

The painting was bold and vibrant, a swirling mix of colors that seemed to pulse with energy. It was different from her usual work—less structured, more raw.  

“It’s incredible,” Ethan said, his voice sincere.  

Maya smiled, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thanks. I’ve been experimenting with something new. Trying to figure out where I want to go next.”  

Ethan frowned, sensing the weight in her words. “What do you mean?”  

She sighed, crossing her arms. “I love it here—this studio, this campus, the life I’ve built. But sometimes I feel like I’m standing still, like I’m waiting for something to happen instead of making it happen.”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to respond. “You’re doing amazing things, Maya. Anyone can see that.”  

Maya gave him a small smile. “Thanks, but it’s not just about doing. It’s about feeling like I’m moving forward, you know? Like I’m chasing something bigger.”  

Ethan nodded slowly, her words stirring something in him. He’d always admired her drive, but hearing her doubts made her feel even more real—like she wasn’t just a force of nature but someone grappling with her own uncertainties.  

“What about you?” Maya asked suddenly, turning to face him. “What are you chasing?”  

Ethan blinked, caught off guard. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve always just… followed the plan. School, work, stability. But lately, I’ve been wondering if there’s more to it than that.”  

Maya smiled softly, stepping closer. “There is. You just have to figure out what it looks like for you.”  

The simplicity of her words hit him harder than he expected. He didn’t have an answer yet, but for the first time, he felt like he wanted to start searching.  

---

That afternoon, they skipped the coffee shop and stayed in the studio, talking and painting until the sun dipped below the horizon. Ethan’s hands were a mess of colors, his shirt streaked with paint, but he didn’t care.  

As they cleaned up, Maya handed him a small canvas—a simple, abstract piece she’d finished while they talked.  

“What’s this?” he asked, holding it carefully.  

“Just something to remind you,” she said, her smile warm.  

“Of what?”  

“That there’s no wrong way to figure things out,” she said. “And that you don’t have to do it alone.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened, and for a moment, he couldn’t find the words to respond. Instead, he nodded, tucking the canvas under his arm as they walked out into the cool evening air.  

For the first time, he felt like the future didn’t have to be something to fear. With Maya by his side, it felt like it could be something to look forward to.  

--- 

The days began to blur into a rhythm Ethan hadn’t realized he needed. Mornings were spent in class or at his desk, afternoons at the coffee shop with Maya, and evenings often spilled into her studio, where they talked, painted, or simply existed in each other’s presence.  

But the closer they grew, the more Ethan felt the quiet tug of uncertainty pulling at the edges of his thoughts.  

One evening, as they sat on the floor of Maya’s studio, surrounded by half-finished canvases and the soft glow of string lights, Ethan broke the comfortable silence.  

“Do you ever think about what it’ll be like when we’re not here anymore?” he asked, his voice tentative.  

Maya glanced at him, her brow furrowing. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean… after we graduate,” he said, staring down at the brush in his hand. “When we’re not meeting at the coffee shop every day or hanging out here. What happens then?”  

Maya was quiet for a moment, her expression thoughtful. “I guess I haven’t really thought about it,” she admitted. “But I like to think we’ll figure it out. You know, if it matters enough.”  

Ethan looked up at her, his chest tightening. “What if it’s not that simple?”  

Maya’s lips curved into a small, wistful smile. “It never is,” she said softly. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying.”  

Her words hung in the air, heavy with meaning, and Ethan felt the familiar weight of everything he wasn’t saying pressing down on him.  

“I don’t want to lose this,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya’s gaze softened, and she reached out, her fingers brushing against his. “You won’t,” she said firmly. “Not if we don’t let it happen.”  

Ethan nodded, though the knot in his chest didn’t fully ease.  

---

The following week, Maya invited Ethan to one of her art showcases—a small gallery on campus where students displayed their work.  

The room was filled with bright, chaotic pieces, each one a reflection of the artist who’d created it. Ethan wandered through the space, taking it all in, but his attention kept drifting back to the painting Maya had entered: a swirling, vibrant canvas that seemed to pulse with life.  

“That’s yours, isn’t it?” he asked when she came to stand beside him.  

Maya smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Yeah. What do you think?”  

“It’s incredible,” Ethan said, his voice filled with awe. “It’s… you.”  

Maya blinked, her cheeks flushing slightly. “You think so?”  

He nodded, his gaze never leaving the painting. “It’s everything you are—bold, alive, full of possibility.”  

For a moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of his words settling between them. Then, Maya turned to him, her eyes shimmering with something Ethan couldn’t quite name.  

“Thank you,” she said softly.  

Ethan smiled, though his chest felt tight. “You don’t have to thank me. I’m just telling the truth.”  

---

Later that night, as they walked back across campus, Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted between them.  

Maya had always been a force of nature, but seeing her in the gallery, surrounded by the world she’d created, made him realize just how far apart their dreams might take them.  

And yet, as she looped her arm through his and leaned her head against his shoulder, Ethan couldn’t help but feel like, for now, this was enough.  

Whatever the future held, he wasn’t ready to let go.  

--- 

The morning after the art showcase, Ethan woke with an odd mix of emotions swirling in his chest. Maya’s painting had stayed with him, its colors and energy replaying in his mind like a vivid dream.  

It wasn’t just the painting, though. It was her—the way she’d lit up when talking about her work, the quiet pride in her eyes as people admired it. It was the realization that her world was bigger, brighter, and so much more expansive than his own.  

He wanted to tell her how much it all meant to him, how much *she* meant to him. But as always, the words felt too big, too complicated.  

---

That afternoon, they met at their usual coffee shop, but the mood felt different. Maya was quieter than usual, her sketchbook lying unopened on the table. Ethan watched her, his own coffee growing cold as he tried to read the expression on her face.  

“Everything okay?” he asked finally, his voice breaking the silence.  

Maya looked up, startled, as if she’d forgotten he was there. “Yeah,” she said, forcing a smile. “Just thinking.”  

“About what?”  

She hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her cup. “About the future,” she said softly. “About what happens after all of this.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “You mean after graduation?”  

Maya nodded, her gaze dropping to the table. “I don’t want to lose this,” she said, echoing the words he’d spoken just days before. “But I also know things are going to change. They have to.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the knot in his chest tightening. “We’ll figure it out,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt.  

Maya looked at him, her eyes searching his. “Will we?”  

“Yes,” he said firmly. “We will.”  

For a moment, they just stared at each other, the weight of the unspoken lingering between them. Then Maya smiled—small, tentative, but real.  

“Okay,” she said.  

And just like that, the tension began to ease.  

---

Later, as they walked across campus, Maya looped her arm through Ethan’s, leaning against him as they strolled.  

“Do you think it’s silly?” she asked suddenly.  

“Do I think what’s silly?”  

“My dream,” she said, glancing up at him. “To travel, to paint the world. Sometimes it feels so… impractical.”  

Ethan stopped, turning to face her. “It’s not silly,” he said, his voice firm. “It’s brave. And it’s beautiful.”  

Maya blinked, her cheeks flushing. “You really think so?”  

“I do,” Ethan said. “And I think you’ll make it happen, no matter what.”  

Her smile was brighter this time, and she squeezed his arm. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”  

As they continued walking, Ethan couldn’t help but feel a quiet sense of certainty settling over him. Whatever challenges lay ahead, he knew one thing for sure: he wanted to be there for her, every step of the way.  

--- 

As the semester progressed, the days grew shorter, and the air carried a crisp chill that hinted at the approaching winter. Ethan found himself savoring every moment he spent with Maya, acutely aware of how fleeting their time felt.  

One evening, after a particularly long day of classes, Ethan found himself back at Maya’s studio. The room was warm and bright, filled with the familiar scent of paint and the hum of quiet music playing in the background.  

Maya was perched on a stool in front of her easel, a splash of green paint smudged on her cheek. She looked up as Ethan entered, her face lighting up in a way that never failed to make his chest tighten.  

“Hey,” she said, setting down her brush. “What are you doing here? I thought you had that big project due tomorrow.”  

“I finished it early,” Ethan said, dropping his bag by the door. “Thought I’d come see what you were working on.”  

Maya smiled, gesturing for him to come closer. “Well, you’re just in time. I was about to start on something new.”  

Ethan leaned against the edge of her worktable, watching as she grabbed a fresh canvas and set it on the easel. “What’s this one going to be?” he asked.  

Maya shrugged, her expression thoughtful. “Not sure yet. I was thinking about doing something abstract again—something that feels… alive.”  

Ethan nodded, his gaze drifting to the array of colors spread out on her palette. “Do you ever feel nervous?” he asked suddenly.  

Maya glanced at him, her brow furrowing. “About what?”  

“About putting so much of yourself into your work,” Ethan said. “About people seeing it and… not getting it.”  

Maya smiled faintly, dipping her brush into a deep red. “All the time,” she admitted. “But that’s part of it, isn’t it? Creating something and hoping it connects with someone, even if it’s just one person.”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her words sinking in. “I think it’s incredible,” he said softly.  

Maya looked at him, her eyes warm. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”  

---

Later that night, as they cleaned up, Maya handed Ethan a blank canvas and a small set of paints.  

“What’s this for?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.  

“Homework,” she said with a grin.  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “I think I’ve got enough homework, thanks.”  

“Not like this,” Maya said, her smile widening. “I want you to paint something—anything. It doesn’t have to be good. Just… something that feels like you.”  

Ethan hesitated, but the look in her eyes made it impossible to refuse. “Alright,” he said, tucking the canvas under his arm. “But don’t expect much.”  

“I never do,” Maya teased, her laughter following him out the door.  

---

When Ethan got back to his dorm, he set the canvas on his desk and stared at it for what felt like hours.  

Maya made it look so easy—pouring her heart into her art, letting her emotions spill out onto the canvas. But for Ethan, it felt impossibly daunting.  

Still, he picked up the brush.  

At first, he wasn’t sure what he was doing. His strokes were hesitant, the colors clashing in ways that made him wince. But as he kept going, something shifted. He stopped thinking and just… painted.  

By the time he finished, the canvas was a chaotic swirl of blues and reds, streaked with lines of black and gold. It wasn’t perfect, but it was honest—an expression of everything he couldn’t put into words.  

As he sat back, exhaustion pulling at him, Ethan realized something surprising: for the first time in a long while, he felt lighter.  

And maybe, just maybe, he was starting to understand what Maya had been trying to teach him all along.  

--- 

The next afternoon, Ethan carried the painted canvas to Maya’s studio. He wasn’t sure what to expect—whether she’d laugh, offer pointers, or simply give him one of her trademark teasing smirks.  

When he walked through the door, Maya was sitting on the floor, surrounded by an explosion of colored paper and scraps of fabric. She looked up, her face lighting up when she saw him.  

“You brought it!” she said, scrambling to her feet. “Let me see.”  

Ethan hesitated, gripping the canvas a little tighter. “It’s not great,” he warned.  

“Let me be the judge of that,” Maya said, holding out her hands.  

Reluctantly, Ethan handed it to her, watching as her eyes scanned the swirling colors and jagged lines.  

For a moment, she didn’t say anything. Then, she looked up at him, her expression softer than he’d ever seen it.  

“Ethan,” she said quietly, “this is… incredible.”  

He blinked, caught off guard. “Really?”  

“Yes,” she said, her voice firm. “It’s raw and honest and so… you.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure how to respond. He’d spent so much time second-guessing himself, convinced that whatever he created couldn’t possibly measure up. But hearing Maya’s words, seeing the sincerity in her eyes, made something inside him shift.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice soft.  

Maya smiled, setting the canvas down carefully. “You should do this more often,” she said.  

“What, painting?”  

“Yeah,” she said, nodding. “Not because you’re trying to be an artist, but because it makes you happy. And you deserve that.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I’m not sure I’d call it happiness,” he admitted. “But it does feel… good. Like I’m letting something out.”  

Maya’s smile widened. “That’s the point.”  

---

They spent the rest of the afternoon working side by side, Maya cutting and gluing pieces for a collage while Ethan started on another canvas.  

This time, he didn’t feel as hesitant. The colors came easier, the strokes more fluid. He didn’t worry about whether it looked good or made sense—he just let it happen.  

When he finally set the brush down, Maya glanced over, her eyes lighting up.  

“See?” she said, her tone teasing but warm. “I told you you’d get the hang of it.”  

Ethan laughed, shaking his head. “I don’t think I’ll ever ‘get the hang’ of it, but… it’s not as bad as I thought.”  

Maya grinned, leaning over to nudge his shoulder. “That’s progress.”  

---

As the evening wore on, the conversation shifted to lighter topics—childhood memories, favorite movies, and embarrassing stories that left them both laughing until their sides ached.  

At one point, Maya turned to him, her expression thoughtful.  

“You know,” she said, “I think this is my favorite version of you.”  

Ethan raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”  

“This,” she said, gesturing to him. “Relaxed, open, not overthinking everything. It suits you.”  

Ethan smiled, a faint blush creeping up his neck. “I guess I have you to thank for that.”  

Maya’s smile softened. “I think it was always there,” she said. “You just needed someone to remind you.”  

The words stayed with Ethan long after he left the studio that night. For the first time, he felt like he was beginning to understand himself—not just who he was, but who he could be.  

And for that, he knew he had Maya to thank.  

--- 

As winter crept closer, the days grew shorter, and the time Ethan and Maya spent together felt more precious. The routines they’d built—afternoons at the coffee shop, evenings in the studio—became an anchor for Ethan, a constant he found himself clinging to.  

But as much as he cherished their moments, he couldn’t ignore the quiet questions that lingered in the back of his mind. What would happen when the semester ended? When graduation loomed closer, and life began pulling them in different directions?  

He hadn’t voiced those fears yet, and neither had Maya. But some nights, when the studio was quiet, and the only sound was the scratch of her pencil against paper, Ethan wondered if she was thinking the same thing.  

---

One evening, as they walked across campus, Maya slowed her pace, glancing up at the sky.  

“Do you ever feel like time moves too fast?” she asked, her voice soft.  

Ethan glanced at her, surprised. “All the time.”  

Maya smiled faintly, her gaze distant. “I don’t want to look back and feel like I missed something important, you know? Like I didn’t make the most of it.”  

“You’re not missing anything,” Ethan said, his voice steady. “If anything, you’re the one teaching the rest of us how to live in the moment.”  

Maya laughed lightly, though there was a wistfulness to it. “Sometimes I think I’m just pretending,” she admitted. “Like I’m trying so hard to soak it all in because I’m scared of what comes next.”  

Ethan stopped walking, turning to face her. “You don’t have to figure it all out right now,” he said. “You’re allowed to just… be.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes softening. “You always know the right thing to say,” she said quietly.  

Ethan’s chest tightened, and for a moment, he thought about telling her everything—how much she meant to him, how terrified he was of losing her. But the words caught in his throat, and the moment passed.  

---

Later that night, as they sat in her studio, Maya pulled out a small, wrapped package and handed it to him.  

“What’s this?” Ethan asked, his brow furrowing.  

“An early Christmas present,” Maya said, grinning. “Go on, open it.”  

Ethan hesitated, then carefully tore the wrapping paper to reveal a hardcover journal. The cover was a deep navy blue, and his name was embossed in gold lettering on the front.  

“I figured you needed a place to keep all your ideas,” Maya said, her smile soft.  

Ethan stared at the journal, his chest tightening. “Maya, this is…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “Thank you. Really.”  

“You’re welcome,” she said, nudging him playfully. “Just promise me you’ll actually use it.”  

Ethan chuckled, running his fingers over the smooth cover. “I promise.”  

---

That night, as he sat at his desk, Ethan opened the journal and stared at the blank pages.  

He wasn’t sure where to start, but as he picked up his pen, he found himself writing about Maya—about her laughter, her passion, the way she made the world feel bigger and brighter.  

The words came slowly at first, then faster, spilling out in a way that felt almost effortless.  

By the time he set the pen down, the knot in his chest had eased, replaced by a quiet sense of clarity.  

He didn’t know what the future held, but for now, he was certain of one thing: Maya was the best thing that had ever happened to him.  

--- 

Winter break was just around the corner, and the campus was beginning to quiet down. Students rushed to finish final projects and prepare for the holidays, but for Ethan, everything outside his time with Maya felt like background noise.  

One evening, as snow flurries swirled in the air, they sat on a bench in the park. The trees were bare, their branches dusted with white, and the world around them felt still and hushed.  

Maya tucked her hands into her coat pockets, her breath forming soft clouds in the cold air. “I love the first snow,” she said, her voice quiet. “It always feels… magical.”  

Ethan glanced at her, his heart catching at the way the snowflakes clung to her hair, the soft glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes.  

“It is,” he said, though he wasn’t sure if he was talking about the snow or her.  

Maya smiled, tilting her head to look at him. “You’ve been quiet tonight. What’s on your mind?”  

Ethan hesitated, his gaze dropping to his hands. “Just… everything,” he admitted. “The semester ending, winter break, what happens after.”  

Maya’s smile faded slightly, and she looked down at the ground. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I’ve been thinking about that too.”  

Ethan exhaled, the knot in his chest tightening. “I don’t want this to change,” he said quietly. “I don’t want us to lose this.”  

Maya reached out, her hand brushing against his. “We won’t,” she said firmly. “No matter what, Ethan. We’ll figure it out.”  

Her words brought a small measure of comfort, but the uncertainty lingered. Ethan wanted to believe her, but a part of him couldn’t help but worry about the things they couldn’t control.  

---

A few days later, they met in Maya’s studio for what had become their usual evening routine. The room was warm and inviting, the faint hum of music in the background and the soft glow of string lights casting a cozy atmosphere.  

Maya was working on a new painting, her brush moving in quick, confident strokes. Ethan sat nearby, his journal open in his lap, though he hadn’t written much.  

“What’s that one about?” he asked, nodding toward her canvas.  

Maya paused, glancing over her shoulder at him. “It’s… complicated,” she said with a small smile. “Kind of like how I’ve been feeling lately. A little all over the place.”  

Ethan nodded, understanding more than he let on. “It’s beautiful,” he said softly.  

Maya’s smile widened, and she turned back to her work. “Thanks. I’m not sure if it’ll ever feel finished, though.”  

“Maybe it doesn’t have to be,” Ethan said, surprising himself with the thought. “Maybe some things are meant to stay open, like they’re still growing.”  

Maya stopped, her brush hovering over the canvas. She turned to look at him, her expression thoughtful. “You know, sometimes I forget how wise you are,” she said, her voice teasing but warm.  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “I think you give me too much credit.”  

Maya set her brush down and crossed the room to sit beside him. “No, I don’t,” she said, her tone serious now. “You see things in a way most people don’t, Ethan. And I think you underestimate how much that matters.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I don’t know what I’d do without you,” he said quietly.  

Maya’s eyes softened, and she reached out to take his hand. “You won’t have to find out,” she said simply.  

In that moment, with her hand in his and the quiet warmth of her words wrapping around him, Ethan felt like maybe—just maybe—they could hold on to this, no matter what the future brought.

The last week of the semester arrived in a blur of deadlines and farewells. Campus buzzed with an electric mix of excitement and anxiety as students prepared to leave for the holidays. For Ethan, though, the thought of winter break felt bittersweet.  

He and Maya hadn’t talked about what the time apart might mean for them. Their unspoken understanding kept them grounded, but it also left questions lingering just beneath the surface.

One evening, as they walked back from the coffee shop, Maya broke the silence.  

“So,” she began, her breath forming soft clouds in the cold air, “are you going home for the break?”  

Ethan nodded. “Yeah. My parents have been asking me to visit for weeks. What about you?”  

“Same,” Maya said, kicking at a patch of snow on the sidewalk. “It’s been a while since I’ve seen my mom. She’s been dying to hear all about my ‘artistic endeavors.’”  

Ethan chuckled. “She must be proud of you.”  

Maya shrugged, her expression softening. “I think so. She doesn’t always understand what I’m doing, but she tries. That means a lot.”  

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts swirling. “Do you think it’ll be weird? Not seeing each other every day, I mean.”  

Maya slowed her pace, glancing at him. “A little, maybe. But it’s only a few weeks, right? And we’ll stay in touch.”  

Ethan nodded, though her words didn’t fully ease the tightness in his chest. “Yeah. Of course.”  

Maya bumped his shoulder playfully, her smile brightening. “You’ll survive without me, you know. I’m not *that* amazing.”  

Ethan smiled back, though his heart ached with the thought of even a temporary separation. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that.”

On their last evening together before the break, Maya invited Ethan to her studio one final time.  

The room felt different that night—quieter, heavier. The usual hum of activity was replaced by a stillness that neither of them dared to break.  

“I made something for you,” Maya said suddenly, pulling a small canvas from behind her easel.  

She handed it to Ethan, her expression nervous but expectant. The painting was abstract, a swirling mix of blues and golds that reminded him of sunlight reflecting on water.  

“It’s not much,” she said, fidgeting with the hem of her sweater. “Just something to remind you of… us.”  

Ethan stared at the canvas, his chest tightening. “Maya, this is…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “It’s perfect. Thank you.”  

Maya smiled, her shoulders relaxing. “I’m glad you like it.”  

For a moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of the impending separation settling between them.  

“I’m going to miss this,” Ethan said quietly, his gaze fixed on the painting.  

Maya stepped closer, her voice soft. “Me too. But we’ll figure it out, Ethan. We always do.”  

Ethan looked at her, the words he’d been holding back threatening to spill over. “Maya, I—”  

But before he could finish, she leaned in, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug.  

“You don’t have to say it,” she whispered, her voice steady. “I know.”  

Ethan closed his eyes, holding her close as the weight in his chest eased, just a little.  

For now, this was enough.

That night, as Ethan packed for his trip home, he placed Maya’s painting carefully on his desk, propping it up so it was the first thing he’d see when he returned.  

And as he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, he found himself smiling.  

Because even though the future felt uncertain, he knew one thing for sure: no matter where life took them, Maya had left a mark on him that he’d carry with him always.
