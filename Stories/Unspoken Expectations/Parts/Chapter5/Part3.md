## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The quiet days that followed brought more reflection than resolution. Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that something was shifting—not just between him and Maya, but within himself.  

One evening, as he sat in the library trying to focus on his notes, his phone buzzed with a message from her.  

**Maya:** Coffee tomorrow?  

The simple text sent a wave of relief through him.  

**Ethan:** Always.

The café was quiet the next afternoon, the soft hum of conversation and clinking of cups creating a cozy backdrop. Ethan arrived early, choosing a table by the window and ordering Maya’s favorite drink—an almond milk latte.  

When she walked in, her eyes scanned the room before landing on him. She smiled, the tension in her face softening as she slid into the seat across from him.  

“Hey,” she said.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, pushing the cup toward her.  

Maya’s grin widened as she took it. “You remembered.”  

“Of course,” Ethan said lightly.  

For a few minutes, they talked about small things—the weather, their classes, the latest drama in their friend group. But eventually, the conversation took a more serious turn.  

“I’ve been thinking,” Maya said, wrapping her hands around her cup.  

“About what?” Ethan asked, leaning forward.  

“About us,” she said softly.  

Ethan’s heart skipped a beat. “What about us?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table. “I feel like we’re at a crossroads, Ethan. Like we’re trying to figure out who we are—individually and together. And it’s… hard.”  

Ethan nodded, his throat tightening. “Yeah, it is. But I think that’s normal, right? We’re both figuring things out.”  

Maya looked up, her eyes searching his. “I know. But sometimes, I feel like I’m asking too much of you. Like I expect you to understand me in ways I don’t even understand myself.”  

Ethan reached across the table, his hand brushing hers. “Maya, you’re not asking too much. I’m here because I want to be. Even when it’s hard.”  

She smiled faintly, though the tension in her expression didn’t fully ease. “Thank you,” she said.

Later, as they walked back to campus together, Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that Maya’s words had been a plea—a quiet hope that he could meet her where she was, even if neither of them knew exactly what that meant.  

And as they parted ways for the evening, Ethan found himself wondering if he could really be the person she needed—or if trying to be that person would mean losing himself in the process.
