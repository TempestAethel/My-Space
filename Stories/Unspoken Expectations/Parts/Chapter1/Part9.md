## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

The next few days passed in a blur of quiet conversations, laughter, and stolen glances. Ethan couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this way—like every moment he spent with Maya was a thread weaving itself into something bigger, something he didn’t fully understand yet.  

He found himself looking forward to their time together more than he cared to admit. The coffee shop, the art studio, the walks across campus—it all felt like their own little world, separate from the chaos of deadlines and expectations.  

But with every passing day, the weight of his unspoken feelings grew heavier.  

One evening, as they walked through the campus park, Maya broke the comfortable silence with a question that caught Ethan off guard.  

“Do you ever think about the future?” she asked, her voice quiet but thoughtful.  

Ethan glanced at her, surprised. “The future?”  

“Yeah,” she said, kicking at a loose pebble on the path. “Like, where you’ll be in five years. Ten years. Who you’ll be with.”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. He’d always thought about the future in practical terms—graduating, getting a job, finding stability. But lately, those plans felt incomplete, like something important was missing.  

“I guess I think about it sometimes,” he said finally. “But it’s hard to picture.”  

Maya nodded, her gaze distant. “Yeah. Same here. I mean, I know what I want to do, but… I don’t know if it’ll all work out the way I hope.”  

“You’ll figure it out,” Ethan said, his voice firm. “You’re too determined not to.”  

Maya smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thanks. I just… sometimes I wish things were simpler, you know? Like, instead of worrying about what comes next, we could just… be.”  

Ethan didn’t respond right away. He wasn’t sure what to say. All he knew was that in that moment, with the golden light of the setting sun casting a warm glow over her face, he wanted to tell her everything—how much she meant to him, how she’d changed his life in ways he couldn’t put into words.  

But the words wouldn’t come.  

Instead, they walked in silence, the air between them thick with everything left unsaid.

That night, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the blank screen of his laptop. He’d been trying to work on a project for hours, but his mind kept drifting back to Maya—her laugh, her smile, the way her voice softened when she talked about her dreams.  

Frustrated, he closed the laptop and leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair. He couldn’t keep doing this—pretending that his feelings didn’t exist, that he could keep their relationship neatly contained in the box of friendship.  

But what if telling her changed everything? What if it ruined the one thing in his life that felt real and steady?  

Ethan sighed, his chest tight with indecision. For someone who prided himself on logic and problem-solving, this was one equation he couldn’t seem to solve.  

All he knew was that he couldn’t keep going like this. Sooner or later, something had to give.
