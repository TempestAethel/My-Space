## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Ethan didn’t know how long he could keep pretending that his feelings for Maya were just friendly. Every time they met at the coffee shop or spent time together at her studio, the line between friendship and something more grew thinner.  

It wasn’t just the way she smiled at him or how her laughter lingered in the air—it was the way she made him feel seen, like he wasn’t just another face in the crowd.  

One evening, as they walked across campus after their usual coffee shop session, Maya turned to him, her expression thoughtful.  

“You ever think about what you want to do after all this?” she asked, gesturing vaguely at the campus around them.  

“After graduation, you mean?”  

“Yeah.”  

Ethan stuffed his hands into his pockets, his gaze fixed on the sidewalk. “I guess I’ll get a job in engineering. Find something stable.”  

Maya wrinkled her nose. “Stable sounds boring.”  

He chuckled softly. “What about you?”  

“Me?” Maya’s eyes lit up, and she turned to walk backward, facing him. “I’m going to travel. Visit all the places I’ve only seen in books and movies. Paris, Tokyo, maybe even some tiny village in Italy where nobody knows my name. I want to paint everything—capture the world on my canvas.”  

Ethan smiled, though a part of him felt an odd ache at the thought of her leaving. “That sounds… incredible.”  

“It will be,” she said with certainty. Then, her gaze softened, and she added, “You should come with me.”  

Ethan stopped in his tracks, caught off guard. “What?”  

“Not forever,” she said quickly, as if reading his mind. “Just for a little while. You could take a break before starting your big, stable engineering job. See the world. Live a little.”  

Her words lingered in the air between them, filled with possibility. Ethan wanted to say yes, but something held him back—a quiet voice in the back of his mind reminding him of responsibilities, expectations, and the carefully planned path he’d always followed.  

“I don’t know,” he said finally, his voice quiet.  

Maya smiled faintly, a mix of understanding and disappointment in her eyes. “Think about it,” she said, turning to walk ahead of him again. “You’ve got time.”  

They walked in silence after that, the weight of the conversation settling over them. By the time they reached the edge of campus, where their paths usually diverged, Maya turned to him with her usual bright smile, as if nothing had changed.  

“Same time tomorrow?” she asked.  

Ethan nodded. “Same time.”  

But as he watched her walk away, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted—something he didn’t fully understand yet.  

---

That night, Ethan couldn’t sleep. He stared at the ceiling, Maya’s words echoing in his mind.  

“You should come with me.”  

It wasn’t just the idea of traveling that unsettled him—it was the realization that, for the first time, he wanted something more than stability, more than the carefully constructed life he’d always envisioned.  

He wanted her.  

But how could he tell her that without risking everything they’d built? What if she didn’t feel the same way? What if his feelings ruined the one thing in his life that felt steady and real?  

Ethan sighed, running a hand through his hair. He’d always been good at solving problems, but this was one equation he couldn’t figure out.  

The only thing he knew for certain was that Maya had changed something in him—opened a door he hadn’t even realized was there.  

And now, he wasn’t sure if he could close it again.
