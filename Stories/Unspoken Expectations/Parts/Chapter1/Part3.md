## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Over the next two weeks, the coffee shop became an unspoken part of their routine. Ethan didn’t know how it happened—there was no explicit agreement, no promises exchanged—but every afternoon, like clockwork, Maya would be there, and he would follow.  

They quickly fell into a rhythm: Maya sketching, Ethan typing, the occasional exchange of banter filling the quiet spaces between them. It wasn’t anything extraordinary, and yet, it was. For someone like Ethan, whose days were usually marked by structured routines and predictable outcomes, this new connection felt like stepping into uncharted territory.  

“So,” Maya said one afternoon, tapping her pencil against her cheek as she studied him. “What’s the deal with you, Ethan?”  

He glanced up from his laptop, confused. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, you’re like this mysterious puzzle,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “Quiet, serious, always thinking. What’s going on in that head of yours?”  

Ethan chuckled, a little nervously. “Not much, honestly. Just trying to keep up with deadlines.”  

“Liar,” she said with a grin, her eyes narrowing playfully. “You’ve got that faraway look sometimes. Like you’re carrying the weight of the world. Spill.”  

He hesitated, unsure how to respond. No one had ever asked him something like that before. Not really.  

“I guess I’m just… used to keeping things to myself,” he admitted finally, his voice quieter than usual.  

Maya’s expression softened, and for a moment, she was silent. “You don’t have to, you know,” she said, her voice equally soft. “Keep everything to yourself, I mean. You can talk to me. If you want.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure why her words affected him the way they did. Maybe it was the sincerity in her tone, or the way her gaze held his, steady and unflinching. Either way, something shifted in him at that moment, like a door creaking open just a crack.  

“Thanks,” he said simply, not trusting himself to say more.  

The conversation moved on after that, as it always did. Maya had a way of keeping things light when they needed to be, of pulling Ethan out of his own head and into the present moment.  

But later that night, as Ethan lay in bed staring at the ceiling, her words echoed in his mind.  

You can talk to me.  

It wasn’t something he’d heard often—not from his parents, who were loving but distant, nor from his friends, who preferred surface-level conversations over anything too deep. The idea that someone actually wanted to understand him was… new. And terrifying.  

The next day, as they sat across from each other in the coffee shop, Ethan found himself studying Maya more closely. She was different from anyone he’d ever met—passionate, expressive, unafraid to speak her mind. She talked about her art with a kind of fervor that Ethan couldn’t help but admire, even if he didn’t fully understand it.  

“You know,” he said suddenly, surprising himself, “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like you.”  

Maya looked up, startled. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean… you’re just so…” He struggled to find the right word. “Alive. Like, you see the world in this way that most people don’t. It’s… inspiring.”  

For the first time since he’d met her, Maya seemed genuinely at a loss for words. A faint blush crept into her cheeks, and she ducked her head, hiding her smile behind her hand.  

“Careful, Ethan,” she said after a moment, her voice teasing but soft. “Say things like that, and you might make me like you.”  

The words were light, playful, but they left a strange warmth in the air between them—something unspoken, fragile, and new.  

Ethan didn’t know what it was, exactly, but he knew one thing for certain: he didn’t want to lose it.
