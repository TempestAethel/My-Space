## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

For the first time in years, Ethan found himself looking forward to something outside of his usual routines. It wasn’t just the coffee shop or the quiet hours spent typing away on his laptop—it was Maya. She had a way of lighting up even the dullest moments, of turning everyday conversations into something vivid and alive.  

But beneath the surface of their easy camaraderie, something else was beginning to grow. Ethan could feel it in the way his heart skipped a beat when Maya laughed, or how his chest tightened when their eyes met.  

He wasn’t sure what it was, exactly. All he knew was that it terrified him.  

One evening, as they sat in their usual corner, Maya broke the comfortable silence with a question that caught Ethan off guard.  

“Why engineering?” she asked, resting her chin in her hand as she studied him.  

Ethan blinked, glancing up from his screen. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, why’d you choose it? Was it something you always wanted, or just… practical?”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. “A little of both, I guess. I’ve always been good at math and problem-solving. It just made sense.”  

Maya tilted her head, her expression thoughtful. “Do you like it, though? Like, really like it?”  

Ethan frowned, caught off guard by the question. No one had ever asked him that before—not his parents, not his professors, not even himself.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted after a moment. “I guess I’ve never thought about it that way.”  

Maya smiled faintly, her eyes softening. “That’s the thing about you, Ethan. You’re so good at doing what’s expected of you, but I wonder… what would you do if no one expected anything?”  

The question lingered in the air between them, heavy and unspoken. Ethan didn’t have an answer, but the weight of it settled in his chest, making it hard to breathe.  

“What about you?” he asked, deflecting the spotlight. “Why art?”  

Maya’s face lit up, and for a moment, Ethan forgot about his own uncertainties.  

“I’ve always loved it,” she said, her voice brimming with passion. “The way you can take something as simple as a pencil and paper and turn it into… anything. A feeling, a story, a memory. It’s like magic.”  

Ethan watched her as she spoke, the way her hands moved animatedly, her eyes sparkling with excitement. There was a fire in her that he couldn’t help but admire—a fire he sometimes wished he had for himself.  

“You’re lucky,” he said quietly.  

Maya stopped, tilting her head. “Why do you say that?”  

“Because you know what you love,” he said. “And you’re not afraid to go after it.”  

Her expression softened, and for a moment, she just looked at him, her gaze steady and unflinching. “You know, Ethan,” she said, her voice gentle, “just because you haven’t figured it out yet doesn’t mean you won’t. Everyone’s path is different.”  

The sincerity in her words caught him off guard. For a fleeting moment, he wondered how someone like her—a whirlwind of creativity and passion—could see anything worth admiring in someone like him.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

They stayed until the café began to close, the once-busy room now empty and quiet. As they gathered their things and stepped out into the cool night air, Ethan felt a strange sense of calm settle over him.  

For the first time in a long while, he didn’t feel so alone.  

As they walked across the campus, their footsteps echoing in the quiet, Maya glanced over at him with a small smile. “Same time tomorrow?”  

Ethan nodded, his lips curving into a faint smile of his own. “Same time.”  

And as they parted ways, Ethan couldn’t help but feel that this—whatever it was—was only the beginning.
