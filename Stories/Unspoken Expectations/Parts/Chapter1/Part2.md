## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Ethan found himself returning to the coffee shop every day that week, half-hoping to see Maya again. It wasn’t like him to fixate on someone he barely knew, but there was something magnetic about her—an energy that pulled him in despite his better judgment.  

He’d never been great at starting conversations, let alone maintaining them. His world had always been numbers and formulas, carefully organized and predictable. Maya, on the other hand, seemed like chaos personified: vibrant, unpredictable, and endlessly intriguing.  

On Thursday, his wish was granted.  

She was there, in the same corner seat, with her sketchbook balanced precariously on her knees. This time, though, she looked less focused. Her pencil tapped against the edge of the table, and her eyes darted around the room, as if searching for something—or someone.  

Ethan hesitated in the doorway. His instinct was to turn around and leave before she noticed him, but his feet betrayed him, carrying him toward her table.  

“You’re back,” she said before he could even open his mouth. Her smile was warm but teasing. “Should I be flattered or concerned?”  

“Neither,” Ethan replied, surprising himself with how steady his voice sounded. “It’s just a good spot for studying.”  

“Hmm,” she hummed, narrowing her eyes playfully. “Sure it is. Sit, then. I could use a distraction.”  

Ethan slid into the chair across from her, his backpack hitting the floor with a dull thud. “Not working today?” he asked, nodding toward her sketchbook.  

She sighed, flipping the cover closed. “No inspiration. Everything I try feels… wrong. You ever get like that? Like no matter what you do, it’s just not good enough?”  

He hesitated, the weight of her words settling over him. “Yeah,” he admitted. “All the time.”  

Maya’s eyebrows lifted slightly, as if she hadn’t expected him to understand. “What do you do about it?”  

“Keep going,” he said after a moment. “Even when it feels pointless. Eventually, something clicks.”  

Her lips curved into a small smile. “Practical and logical strikes again.”  

They fell into an easy rhythm after that. Ethan pulled out his laptop, and Maya resumed her sketching. Occasionally, she’d glance up at him, and he’d pretend not to notice, focusing intently on his screen.  

“You know,” she said suddenly, breaking the silence, “you’re not as boring as I thought you’d be.”  

Ethan blinked, unsure whether to feel complimented or insulted. “Thanks… I think?”  

She laughed, a sound that felt like sunlight breaking through clouds. “It’s a good thing. Trust me.”  

For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he wasn’t just another face in the crowd. There was something about the way Maya looked at him—like he was worth noticing—that made him feel lighter, freer.  

As the afternoon stretched into evening, they packed up their things and walked out together. The campus was quiet now, bathed in the soft glow of streetlights.  

“So,” Maya said, stuffing her sketchbook into her bag. “Same time tomorrow?”  

Ethan smiled, a rare, genuine smile that caught even him off guard. “Yeah. Same time.”  

And just like that, the coffee shop became their spot.
