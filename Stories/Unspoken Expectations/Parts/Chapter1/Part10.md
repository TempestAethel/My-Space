## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Ethan avoided Maya for the next two days.  

It wasn’t intentional, at least not at first. He told himself he needed to catch up on schoolwork, that the looming deadlines and assignments couldn’t wait. But deep down, he knew the truth. He was running—from his feelings, from the weight of everything he wanted to say but couldn’t.  

By the third day, Maya sent him a text:  

**Maya**: Did you fall off the face of the Earth, or are you just hiding?  

Ethan stared at the screen, his chest tightening. He could picture her smirking as she typed it, the playful lilt in her voice, the teasing glint in her eyes.  

After a long moment, he typed back:  

**Ethan**: Just busy.  

Her reply came almost instantly.  

**Maya**: Lame excuse. Coffee shop. 5 PM. Be there.  

Ethan exhaled slowly, the corner of his mouth lifting despite himself. Maya didn’t ask for much, but when she did, she made it hard to say no.

When Ethan arrived at the coffee shop later that evening, Maya was already there, her sketchbook open in front of her. She didn’t look up as he approached, her pencil moving across the page with quick, precise strokes.  

“Hey,” he said, sliding into the seat across from her.  

She glanced up, her expression unreadable. “You’re late.”  

“Sorry,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “Got caught up with something.”  

Maya studied him for a moment before setting her pencil down. “You’ve been avoiding me,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact.  

Ethan froze. “I haven’t—”  

“Don’t lie,” she interrupted, her tone gentle but firm. “It’s fine if you needed space, but at least be honest about it.”  

Ethan sighed, slumping back in his chair. “I wasn’t avoiding you,” he said quietly. “Not really. I just… I’ve had a lot on my mind.”  

Maya’s expression softened, and she leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand. “You want to talk about it?”  

Ethan hesitated. Part of him wanted to tell her everything—that she was the reason he couldn’t focus, that every time he saw her, it felt like the ground beneath him was shifting. But the other part of him was terrified of what might happen if he did.  

“It’s nothing,” he said finally, forcing a small smile. “Just school stuff.”  

Maya frowned but didn’t press him. Instead, she picked up her pencil and resumed sketching. For a while, they sat in silence, the familiar rhythm of their routine settling between them.  

But tonight, it felt different. The unspoken tension hung in the air, heavier than usual, and Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that Maya knew more than she was letting on.

Later, as they walked out together, Maya stopped suddenly, turning to face him.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice quiet but steady.  

He looked at her, his heart pounding. “Yeah?”  

She hesitated, her gaze searching his. For a moment, it seemed like she was about to say something important, something that might shatter the fragile balance they’d been holding onto.  

But then she smiled—a small, wistful smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.  

“Never mind,” she said, stepping back. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”  

Ethan nodded, though the tightness in his chest didn’t ease. “Yeah. Tomorrow.”  

As he watched her walk away, he couldn’t help but wonder what she’d been about to say—and why a part of him was so afraid to hear it.
