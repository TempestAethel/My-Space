## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

The next morning, Ethan woke up with a knot in his stomach.  

His mind kept replaying the way Maya had looked at him the night before—the hesitation in her eyes, the way her smile hadn’t quite reached her usual brightness. He couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d been holding back, just like he was.  

He wanted to believe that ignoring the growing tension between them would make it go away, but deep down, he knew better.  

By the time afternoon rolled around, Ethan found himself standing outside her studio, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. He wasn’t sure why he was there. He hadn’t texted or called ahead, and for all he knew, she might not even be there.  

But when he pushed open the door, the familiar scent of paint and lavender greeted him, and there she was—sitting cross-legged on the floor, her sketchbook balanced on her knees.  

Maya looked up as he entered, her expression surprised but not unwelcoming. “Ethan?”  

“Hey,” he said, his voice softer than he’d intended.  

She set her sketchbook aside, brushing her hands on her jeans as she stood. “What’s up? I thought we were meeting later.”  

“I know,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I just… needed to talk to you.”  

Maya tilted her head, studying him. “Okay,” she said, crossing her arms. “What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, his throat dry. The words were right there, just waiting to be said, but they felt impossibly heavy.  

“I—” He stopped, exhaling sharply. “I don’t know how to say this.”  

Maya’s expression softened, and she took a step closer. “Ethan, whatever it is, you can tell me. You know that, right?”  

Her words were gentle, but they only made the knot in his chest tighten. He looked at her—the way her hair fell in soft waves over her shoulders, the way her eyes held a mix of curiosity and concern—and something in him broke.  

“I’m scared,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya blinked, startled. “Scared? Of what?”  

“Of ruining this,” he admitted, gesturing vaguely between them. “Of saying the wrong thing and losing you.”  

Maya’s brow furrowed, and she stepped even closer, her gaze steady. “Ethan, you’re not going to lose me. Whatever it is, just say it.”  

He hesitated for a moment longer, then finally let the words spill out.  

“I care about you,” he said, his voice trembling. “More than I probably should. And it’s been driving me crazy because I don’t know how to handle it. I don’t want to mess this up, but I also can’t pretend like I don’t feel this way.”  

The silence that followed was deafening. Ethan’s heart pounded in his chest, every second stretching into an eternity as he waited for her response.  

Maya’s expression was unreadable, her gaze fixed on him. Then, slowly, a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips.  

“Ethan,” she said softly, “you really are terrible at hiding your feelings, you know that?”  

He blinked, caught off guard. “What?”  

She laughed lightly, the sound breaking the tension like sunlight piercing through clouds. “I’ve known for a while,” she admitted. “I was just waiting for you to figure it out.”  

Ethan stared at her, his mind racing. “You… knew?”  

Maya nodded, her smile growing. “And for the record, I care about you too. Probably more than I should.”  

Relief flooded through him, so overwhelming it was almost dizzying. He let out a shaky laugh, running a hand through his hair. “So… what now?”  

Maya tilted her head thoughtfully, her eyes sparkling with a mix of mischief and warmth. “Now,” she said, stepping closer, “we stop pretending.”  

Before Ethan could respond, she leaned in and wrapped her arms around him in a hug that felt like coming home.  

And for the first time in weeks, the weight in his chest lifted.  

Whatever happened next, they’d face it together.
