## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Ethan found himself thinking about Maya more than he cared to admit. It wasn’t just the time they spent together, though those moments felt like they carried their own gravity. It was the way her voice lingered in his thoughts, her laughter playing like a distant melody long after they’d parted ways.

That weekend, Maya invited him to her art studio—a small, cluttered space tucked away in an older part of campus. Ethan hesitated at first, feeling out of place among the bright canvases and jars of paint, but Maya’s enthusiasm was infectious.  

“Come on, don’t just stand there,” she said, grabbing his hand and pulling him toward a half-finished painting propped against the wall. “Tell me what you think.”  

The painting was abstract, full of swirling colors and textures that seemed to shift and change the longer he looked at it. Ethan had no idea how to interpret it, but he didn’t want to disappoint her.  

“It’s… beautiful,” he said finally, and he meant it.  

Maya beamed, her eyes lighting up. “Thanks. It’s not finished yet, but it’s getting there.”  

Ethan watched as she picked up a brush and started adding small strokes of blue to the canvas. Her movements were precise yet fluid, as if she were following some invisible rhythm only she could hear.  

“You really love this, don’t you?” he said quietly.  

Maya paused, glancing at him over her shoulder. “I do. It’s the only thing that makes sense to me sometimes.”  

Ethan nodded, though he couldn’t fully relate. His own path had always been dictated by practicality and logic, not passion. Watching Maya, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy.  

“What about you?” she asked, turning back to him. “What’s your thing?”  

“My thing?”  

“Yeah,” she said, smiling. “What makes you feel alive?”  

Ethan hesitated, caught off guard by the question. He wanted to say something meaningful, something that would match the fire in her eyes, but all he could manage was a shrug.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve never really thought about it.”  

Maya studied him for a moment, her expression thoughtful. “Well,” she said finally, setting down her brush, “maybe it’s time you did.”  

Her words stayed with him long after he left the studio. That night, as he lay in bed, Ethan found himself staring at the ceiling, replaying the conversation in his mind.  

What makes you feel alive?  

He didn’t have an answer yet, but for the first time, he realized he wanted to find one.

The following week, their usual coffee shop routine continued, but something felt different. Maya seemed more animated, her sketches growing bolder and more intricate with each passing day. Ethan, meanwhile, found himself opening up in ways he never had before.  

One afternoon, as they sat in their usual corner, Ethan surprised himself by sharing a memory from his childhood—a story about building a treehouse with his dad and the frustration of trying to get every measurement just right.  

Maya laughed, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “That’s so you,” she said, shaking her head. “Even as a kid, you were all about precision.”  

Ethan grinned, feeling a warmth spread through him at her laughter. “What about you? Were you always into art?”  

“Pretty much,” she said, resting her chin in her hand. “My mom used to say I’d cover every surface in the house with doodles if she let me. I guess I just never stopped.”  

They fell into an easy rhythm after that, trading stories and teasing each other about their quirks. For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he didn’t have to overthink every word or action. With Maya, everything just… flowed.  

As the evening wore on, Ethan found himself glancing at her more often, noticing the way the light caught the strands of her hair, the way her lips curved when she smiled.  

He didn’t say anything, but deep down, he knew: he was falling for her.
