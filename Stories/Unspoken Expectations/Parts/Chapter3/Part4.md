## Chapter 3: A Winter Apart (Continued)  

The morning Ethan returned to campus, the sky was a pale gray, and the air carried the crispness of early January. Snow still clung to the edges of the sidewalks, but most of it had been cleared away, leaving the familiar paths open again.  

Ethan’s car was packed with the essentials—his books, his laptop, and Maya’s painting, which he’d carefully wrapped and tucked between layers of clothing in his suitcase. He hadn’t told her he’d brought it. Somehow, it felt too personal, like sharing it would say more than he was ready to admit.  

As he pulled into the parking lot near his dorm, Ethan’s phone buzzed with a text.  

**Maya:** You back yet?  

He smiled, typing back quickly.  

**Ethan:** Just parked. You?  

Her reply came a moment later.  

**Maya:** Studio. Come find me?  

Ethan didn’t even bother unpacking. He grabbed his coat, locked the car, and started walking.

When he pushed open the door to Maya’s studio, the familiar scent of paint and turpentine greeted him. Maya was at her easel, her back to him, her brush moving in slow, deliberate strokes.  

“Hey,” Ethan said softly, not wanting to startle her.  

Maya turned, her face lighting up when she saw him. “Ethan!”  

She set down her brush and crossed the room quickly, wrapping her arms around him in a hug that was warm and unreserved. Ethan hugged her back, his chest tightening with the relief of being near her again.  

“You made it,” she said, pulling back slightly to look at him.  

“I told you I would,” he said, smiling.  

Maya grinned, stepping back and gesturing toward her easel. “What do you think?”  

The painting was bold and vibrant, a swirling mix of colors that seemed to radiate energy. It was different from anything Ethan had seen her do before, and yet, it felt unmistakably hers.  

“It’s incredible,” he said honestly.  

Maya tilted her head, studying his expression. “You really think so?”  

“I do,” Ethan said. “It’s you, Maya. All of it.”  

She smiled, her eyes softening. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”

They spent the afternoon in the studio, falling back into the rhythm that had become so natural to them. Ethan sat at the worktable, flipping through his journal as Maya painted.  

“Did you write anything over the break?” she asked, glancing at him.  

“A little,” Ethan admitted. “Nothing good, though.”  

Maya frowned playfully. “You always say that. Let me see.”  

Ethan hesitated, then handed her the journal. He watched nervously as she flipped through the pages, her brow furrowing slightly as she read.  

When she looked up, her expression was unreadable. “Ethan,” she said quietly, “this is… beautiful.”  

He blinked, caught off guard. “Really?”  

Maya nodded, her gaze steady. “You have a way of seeing things, of putting them into words, that’s so honest. It’s rare.”  

Ethan felt his cheeks warm under her praise. “Thanks,” he said softly.  

Maya smiled, handing the journal back to him. “You should share this with more people. I think it would mean a lot to them.”  

Ethan shook his head, laughing nervously. “I don’t know about that.”  

“Just think about it,” Maya said, her voice gentle but firm.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the room, Maya set down her brush and turned to Ethan.  

“I’m glad you’re back,” she said, her tone quiet but earnest.  

Ethan met her gaze, the words catching in his throat. “Me too,” he said finally.  

For a moment, they just looked at each other, the silence between them heavy with everything they weren’t saying. Then Maya smiled, the kind of smile that felt like sunlight breaking through clouds.  

“Same time tomorrow?” she asked.  

Ethan nodded, his own smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “Same time.”  

As he walked back to his dorm that evening, the weight of winter break lifted from his shoulders, replaced by a quiet, steady warmth.  

Because no matter what lay ahead, he and Maya were here, together. And for now, that was enough.
