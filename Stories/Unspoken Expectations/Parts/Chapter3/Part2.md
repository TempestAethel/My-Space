## Chapter 3: A Winter Apart (Continued)  

The days of winter break drifted by in a blur of family traditions and quiet introspection. Ethan found himself slipping into old routines—helping his dad string up new lights along the roofline, cooking with his mom, and catching up with childhood friends he hadn’t seen in months.  

But even in the midst of all the holiday cheer, Maya was never far from his thoughts.  

Their texts continued every day, a steady thread that tethered him to her world. Sometimes they were short and lighthearted—a quick joke about his mom’s obsession with themed holiday napkins or a picture of Maya’s latest, half-finished painting.  

Other times, they were longer, deeper.  

**Maya:** Do you ever feel like everyone expects you to have all the answers? Like you’re supposed to know exactly what you’re doing all the time?  

Ethan paused before replying, her question resonating more than he cared to admit.  

**Ethan:** All the time. It’s like there’s this invisible clock ticking, and everyone’s waiting for me to hit the next milestone.  

**Maya:** Exactly. It’s exhausting. Sometimes I just want to hit pause, you know?  

**Ethan:** Yeah. But I think you’re doing better than you give yourself credit for.  

There was a long pause before her reply came through.  

**Maya:** You always know how to make me feel better.  

Ethan smiled, the words warming him in a way that no fireplace ever could.

One snowy evening, Ethan found himself sitting in his room, staring at the small canvas Maya had given him. It rested on his desk, its swirling blues and golds catching the dim light.  

He picked it up, running his fingers over the textured paint. It was strange, he thought, how something so abstract could feel so deeply personal.  

Setting it back down, he grabbed his journal and opened it to a blank page. The pen hovered in his hand for a moment before he began to write.  

He wrote about the way Maya saw the world—how she turned ordinary moments into something extraordinary. He wrote about the way she made him feel—like he was more than the sum of his parts, like he could be something greater than he’d ever imagined.  

And as the words filled the page, he realized something that had been quietly growing inside him for weeks.  

He loved her.  

The realization wasn’t a thunderclap or a sudden jolt. It was a quiet truth, steady and undeniable.  

Ethan set the pen down, his heart pounding. He didn’t know what to do with the realization, or if he even needed to do anything at all. But for now, it felt good just to know.

The next night, Maya called again.  

“I have a crazy idea,” she said, her voice buzzing with excitement.  

Ethan chuckled, leaning back against his pillows. “Alright, let’s hear it.”  

“What if we took a trip over spring break?” she said. “Somewhere new, somewhere inspiring. Just the two of us.”  

Ethan hesitated, his mind racing. “Where would we go?”  

“I don’t know,” Maya admitted. “We could figure it out together. It doesn’t have to be far, just… somewhere different. Somewhere that feels like ours.”  

The thought of it—just him and Maya, away from the noise and expectations of their everyday lives—made Ethan’s chest ache with longing.  

“Okay,” he said finally, his voice soft but sure. “Let’s do it.”  

Maya laughed, the sound bright and full of joy. “Really?”  

“Really,” Ethan said, smiling. “I think it’s exactly what we need.”  

As they talked late into the night, tossing around ideas for their trip, Ethan felt a flicker of hope spark inside him.  

Because for the first time, the future didn’t feel so uncertain.  

It felt like the start of something new.
