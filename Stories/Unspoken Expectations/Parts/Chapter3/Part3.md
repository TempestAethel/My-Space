## Chapter 3: A Winter Apart (Continued)  

As winter break stretched on, the days began to take on a familiar rhythm. Ethan spent his mornings helping around the house, his afternoons catching up with old friends, and his evenings either texting or calling Maya.  

The idea of their spring break trip had quickly become a constant thread in their conversations. It was a small thing, really—just a loose plan, no details set—but it felt like a promise, something solid and hopeful in a world that often felt uncertain.

One evening, Maya sent Ethan a picture of a snow-covered field near her house, the fading sunlight casting the landscape in shades of pink and gold.  

**Maya:** Reminds me of that painting you did in the studio.  

Ethan stared at the picture, a small smile tugging at his lips. He could see what she meant—the colors, the movement, the quiet beauty of it all.  

**Ethan:** Guess you’re rubbing off on me.  

Her reply came quickly.  

**Maya:** That’s the plan.  

Ethan laughed softly, shaking his head. Even from miles away, she had a way of making him feel like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.

A few nights later, as they talked on the phone, Maya brought up the trip again.  

“I was thinking,” she said, her voice light but thoughtful, “maybe we should go somewhere by the water. A beach, or a lake. Somewhere open.”  

“Why the water?” Ethan asked, leaning back against his headboard.  

“It’s calming,” she said. “And endless, in a way. I like that. It reminds me that there’s always something bigger out there, you know?”  

Ethan nodded, even though she couldn’t see him. “Yeah. I get that.”  

“What about you?” she asked. “Do you have any ideas?”  

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts swirling. “Honestly? I think I just want to go somewhere where it’s just us. No distractions, no noise. Just… you and me.”  

Maya was quiet for a moment, and when she spoke again, her voice was soft. “I like the sound of that.”  

Ethan smiled, his chest tightening. “Then let’s make it happen.”

The idea of the trip became more than just a plan—it became a symbol of everything Ethan and Maya had built together.  

For Ethan, it was a chance to step outside his carefully constructed routines and take a leap into something unknown. For Maya, it was an opportunity to embrace the kind of freedom she’d always craved.  

But more than anything, it was theirs—a dream they were creating together.

On the last night of winter break, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the journal Maya had given him. The pages were no longer blank—filled instead with scattered thoughts, sketches, and fragments of conversations they’d shared.  

He picked up his pen and began to write.  

“Sometimes I wonder how I got here—how someone like me ended up in the orbit of someone like her. Maya is everything I’m not: bold, fearless, alive. She makes me feel like I can be more, like I already am more, just by being with her.  

The truth is, I don’t know what the future holds. But for the first time, I’m not scared of it. Because wherever it takes me, I know one thing: she’s the reason I’m ready to take the first step.”  

Ethan closed the journal, his heart full.  

Tomorrow, they’d return to campus, to their routines, to the world that often felt too big and overwhelming.  

But for now, as the snow fell softly outside his window, he let himself hold on to the quiet certainty that had grown between them.  

Maya had changed everything. And Ethan was ready to see where that change would lead.
