## Chapter 3: A Winter Apart  

The drive home felt longer than usual, the familiar roads stretching endlessly before Ethan. His parents greeted him with warmth and excitement, the house decked out in festive lights and the scent of pine wafting through the air.  

But even as he settled back into the rhythms of home—family dinners, catching up with old friends, and evenings spent in front of the fireplace—Ethan couldn’t shake the quiet ache of missing Maya.  

It wasn’t that he hadn’t been apart from people before. His life had been full of temporary connections, friendships that faded with time and distance. But this was different.  

Maya was different.

The first text came the night he arrived home.  

**Maya:** Made it back in one piece. My mom is already asking if I’ve “found myself” yet. Classic.  

Ethan laughed, his chest easing as he typed back:  

**Ethan:** Glad you survived. Let me know if you need an escape plan.  

Her reply came almost instantly.  

**Maya:** You’re my first call.  

The conversation carried on late into the night, a string of jokes and updates that made the miles between them feel smaller. By the time Ethan fell asleep, his phone still in hand, he felt lighter.

Over the next few days, their texts became a constant thread running through Ethan’s time at home.  

Maya sent pictures of her mom’s eccentric holiday decorations, including a reindeer made entirely of recycled bottle caps. Ethan responded with shots of his dad’s over-the-top Christmas village display, complete with a miniature train set that took up half the living room.  

Their conversations ranged from the mundane to the deeply personal—Maya’s struggles with finding inspiration for her next project, Ethan’s worries about what came after graduation.  

“I feel like I’m standing at the edge of something huge,” Ethan admitted one night, his words spilling out before he could overthink them. “Like everything’s about to change, and I’m not ready.”  

Maya’s response was immediate.  

“You don’t have to be ready,” she wrote. “You just have to keep moving forward. One step at a time.”  

Ethan stared at the message, the knot in his chest easing slightly. Somehow, Maya always knew exactly what to say.

One evening, as snow fell softly outside his bedroom window, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the journal Maya had given him.  

The blank pages felt less intimidating now, though he still wasn’t sure where to start. After a moment, he picked up his pen and began to write.  

He wrote about the way the snow looked under the streetlights, the quiet stillness of the night. He wrote about the ache of missing Maya, the way her voice lingered in his mind like a melody he couldn’t forget.  

And as the words filled the page, Ethan felt a sense of clarity he hadn’t expected.

Later that night, Maya called.  

“Hey,” she said, her voice warm and familiar. “How’s the holiday madness?”  

Ethan smiled, leaning back in his chair. “Chaotic, as usual. You?”  

“Same,” she said, laughing softly. “But it’s kind of nice, in a way. Makes me appreciate the quiet moments more.”  

They talked for hours, the conversation flowing as easily as it always did. And by the time they said goodnight, Ethan felt closer to her than ever, despite the miles between them.

As the days passed, Ethan began to notice something surprising: the ache of missing Maya hadn’t gone away, but it no longer felt unbearable. Instead, it had become a quiet hum, a reminder of how much she meant to him and how much he wanted to hold on to what they had.  

Because even though they were apart, Ethan knew they were still connected. And for now, that was enough.
