# Unspoken Expectations

## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds  

The days that followed felt like a dream Ethan didn’t want to wake up from.  

For so long, he’d tried to keep his feelings for Maya buried, convinced that admitting them would break whatever fragile connection they’d built. But now that the truth was out, everything felt… lighter. Easier.  

They still met at the coffee shop every day, still spent hours talking about everything and nothing. But there was a new closeness between them—a quiet understanding that made each moment feel more meaningful.  

“Okay,” Maya said one afternoon, setting her sketchbook aside with a flourish. “I’ve decided.”  

Ethan raised an eyebrow, glancing up from his laptop. “Decided what?”  

“That you need to let me teach you something creative,” she said, grinning.  

He chuckled, shaking his head. “Maya, I’m the least creative person you’ve ever met.”  

“Exactly,” she said, leaning forward. “Which is why you need me. Come on, it’ll be fun. You can’t spend your whole life staring at spreadsheets and blueprints.”  

Ethan hesitated, but the look in her eyes made it impossible to say no. “Fine,” he said, sighing dramatically. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Later that evening, they sat cross-legged on the floor of Maya’s studio, surrounded by blank canvases and scattered paint tubes.  

“Okay,” Maya said, handing him a brush. “Rule number one: don’t overthink it. Just let it flow.”  

Ethan stared at the brush like it was a foreign object. “Let it flow? That’s not really how my brain works.”  

Maya laughed, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “Relax, Ethan. It’s just paint. There’s no right or wrong here.”  

He exhaled slowly, dipping the brush into a blob of blue paint. Tentatively, he dragged it across the canvas, leaving a shaky streak in its wake.  

“See?” Maya said, smiling. “You’re a natural.”  

Ethan snorted. “I doubt that.”  

“Hey,” she said, nudging him gently. “This isn’t about being good. It’s about expressing yourself. Just… think about how you’re feeling and let the colors do the talking.”  

Ethan frowned, glancing at the canvas again. He wasn’t sure how to express himself with colors, but as he dipped the brush into a vibrant red, something inside him loosened.  

Minutes turned into hours as they painted side by side, the room filled with laughter and the quiet hum of creativity. Ethan’s strokes grew bolder, more confident, and by the time they finished, his canvas was a chaotic swirl of colors that somehow felt right.  

“Not bad,” Maya said, tilting her head as she studied his work. “Definitely abstract.”  

Ethan chuckled, wiping a smudge of paint from his cheek. “You’re just being nice.”  

“No, really,” she said, her eyes sparkling. “It’s you. Messy, thoughtful, a little chaotic—but it works.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, a warmth spreading through him. “Thanks,” he said quietly.  

Maya smiled, reaching out to brush a streak of paint from his arm. “See? Told you this would be fun.”  

And for the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he’d stepped out of his comfort zone—and found something worth holding onto.

As they cleaned up, Ethan glanced at Maya, his heart full in a way he couldn’t quite explain.  

“You were right,” he said, his voice soft.  

“About what?”  

“About needing this,” he admitted. “About needing you.”  

Maya paused, meeting his gaze. For a moment, neither of them said anything, the weight of his words hanging in the air. Then she smiled—a small, genuine smile that made his chest ache in the best way.  

“Well,” she said, her voice light but warm, “I guess that makes us even.”
