## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The last week of the semester arrived in a blur of deadlines and farewells. Campus buzzed with an electric mix of excitement and anxiety as students prepared to leave for the holidays. For Ethan, though, the thought of winter break felt bittersweet.  

He and Maya hadn’t talked about what the time apart might mean for them. Their unspoken understanding kept them grounded, but it also left questions lingering just beneath the surface.

One evening, as they walked back from the coffee shop, Maya broke the silence.  

“So,” she began, her breath forming soft clouds in the cold air, “are you going home for the break?”  

Ethan nodded. “Yeah. My parents have been asking me to visit for weeks. What about you?”  

“Same,” Maya said, kicking at a patch of snow on the sidewalk. “It’s been a while since I’ve seen my mom. She’s been dying to hear all about my ‘artistic endeavors.’”  

Ethan chuckled. “She must be proud of you.”  

Maya shrugged, her expression softening. “I think so. She doesn’t always understand what I’m doing, but she tries. That means a lot.”  

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts swirling. “Do you think it’ll be weird? Not seeing each other every day, I mean.”  

Maya slowed her pace, glancing at him. “A little, maybe. But it’s only a few weeks, right? And we’ll stay in touch.”  

Ethan nodded, though her words didn’t fully ease the tightness in his chest. “Yeah. Of course.”  

Maya bumped his shoulder playfully, her smile brightening. “You’ll survive without me, you know. I’m not *that* amazing.”  

Ethan smiled back, though his heart ached with the thought of even a temporary separation. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that.”

On their last evening together before the break, Maya invited Ethan to her studio one final time.  

The room felt different that night—quieter, heavier. The usual hum of activity was replaced by a stillness that neither of them dared to break.  

“I made something for you,” Maya said suddenly, pulling a small canvas from behind her easel.  

She handed it to Ethan, her expression nervous but expectant. The painting was abstract, a swirling mix of blues and golds that reminded him of sunlight reflecting on water.  

“It’s not much,” she said, fidgeting with the hem of her sweater. “Just something to remind you of… us.”  

Ethan stared at the canvas, his chest tightening. “Maya, this is…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “It’s perfect. Thank you.”  

Maya smiled, her shoulders relaxing. “I’m glad you like it.”  

For a moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of the impending separation settling between them.  

“I’m going to miss this,” Ethan said quietly, his gaze fixed on the painting.  

Maya stepped closer, her voice soft. “Me too. But we’ll figure it out, Ethan. We always do.”  

Ethan looked at her, the words he’d been holding back threatening to spill over. “Maya, I—”  

But before he could finish, she leaned in, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug.  

“You don’t have to say it,” she whispered, her voice steady. “I know.”  

Ethan closed his eyes, holding her close as the weight in his chest eased, just a little.  

For now, this was enough.

That night, as Ethan packed for his trip home, he placed Maya’s painting carefully on his desk, propping it up so it was the first thing he’d see when he returned.  

And as he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, he found himself smiling.  

Because even though the future felt uncertain, he knew one thing for sure: no matter where life took them, Maya had left a mark on him that he’d carry with him always.
