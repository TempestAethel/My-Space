## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The next week passed in a blur of late nights, laughter, and quiet moments that lingered long after they ended. Ethan found himself craving Maya’s presence more and more, drawn to the way she brought color to his otherwise black-and-white world.  

It wasn’t just her creativity that captivated him—it was her energy, the way she saw beauty in everything and carried herself like the world was full of endless possibilities.  

But with every passing day, a quiet fear grew in the back of Ethan’s mind. What if this was temporary? What if it all came crashing down the moment their lives shifted, as he knew they inevitably would?  

He didn’t bring it up, though. For now, he just wanted to hold on to this—whatever “this” was—for as long as he could.

One evening, as they sat on a bench in the campus park, Maya leaned back, staring up at the stars.  

“You ever wonder what’s out there?” she asked, her voice soft.  

Ethan glanced at her, his brow furrowing. “Out where?”  

“Out there,” she said, gesturing toward the sky. “In the universe. In the places we can’t see.”  

Ethan followed her gaze, the faint glimmer of stars reflected in her eyes. “I guess I’ve never really thought about it,” he admitted.  

Maya smiled faintly, hugging her knees to her chest. “I think about it all the time. How big everything is. How small we are. It’s kind of overwhelming, but also… comforting.”  

“Comforting?” Ethan asked, glancing at her.  

“Yeah,” she said, nodding. “It reminds me that no matter how big our problems feel, they’re just a tiny piece of something so much bigger. It makes it easier to let go.”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her words sinking in. He’d never been good at letting go. His whole life had been about control—about planning, solving, and making sure everything stayed on track.  

But with Maya, things didn’t feel so rigid. They didn’t have to.  

“I think you’re a lot braver than me,” he said finally, his voice quiet.  

Maya turned to him, her expression soft. “Why do you say that?”  

“Because you’re not afraid to just… be,” he said. “To let things happen. I don’t know how to do that.”  

Maya smiled, her eyes warm. “It’s not about being brave, Ethan. It’s about trusting that things will work out, even if you don’t know how. And you don’t have to figure it all out alone, you know.”  

The sincerity in her voice caught him off guard, and for a moment, he couldn’t look away.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya reached out, her fingers brushing against his in a small, fleeting gesture. “You’re welcome,” she said, her smile returning.  

They sat in silence after that, the cool night air wrapping around them as the stars blinked overhead. For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he could breathe—like maybe, just maybe, things didn’t have to be so complicated.

Later that night, as Ethan walked back to his dorm, he found himself smiling for no reason at all.  

Maya had a way of making the world feel bigger and smaller at the same time—like anything was possible, but also like the only thing that mattered was the moment they were in.  

He didn’t know where this was all heading, and for once, he didn’t care. All he knew was that he wanted to keep walking this path with her, wherever it led.
