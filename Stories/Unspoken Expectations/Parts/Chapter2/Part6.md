## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

As the semester progressed, the days grew shorter, and the air carried a crisp chill that hinted at the approaching winter. Ethan found himself savoring every moment he spent with Maya, acutely aware of how fleeting their time felt.  

One evening, after a particularly long day of classes, Ethan found himself back at Maya’s studio. The room was warm and bright, filled with the familiar scent of paint and the hum of quiet music playing in the background.  

Maya was perched on a stool in front of her easel, a splash of green paint smudged on her cheek. She looked up as Ethan entered, her face lighting up in a way that never failed to make his chest tighten.  

“Hey,” she said, setting down her brush. “What are you doing here? I thought you had that big project due tomorrow.”  

“I finished it early,” Ethan said, dropping his bag by the door. “Thought I’d come see what you were working on.”  

Maya smiled, gesturing for him to come closer. “Well, you’re just in time. I was about to start on something new.”  

Ethan leaned against the edge of her worktable, watching as she grabbed a fresh canvas and set it on the easel. “What’s this one going to be?” he asked.  

Maya shrugged, her expression thoughtful. “Not sure yet. I was thinking about doing something abstract again—something that feels… alive.”  

Ethan nodded, his gaze drifting to the array of colors spread out on her palette. “Do you ever feel nervous?” he asked suddenly.  

Maya glanced at him, her brow furrowing. “About what?”  

“About putting so much of yourself into your work,” Ethan said. “About people seeing it and… not getting it.”  

Maya smiled faintly, dipping her brush into a deep red. “All the time,” she admitted. “But that’s part of it, isn’t it? Creating something and hoping it connects with someone, even if it’s just one person.”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her words sinking in. “I think it’s incredible,” he said softly.  

Maya looked at him, her eyes warm. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”

Later that night, as they cleaned up, Maya handed Ethan a blank canvas and a small set of paints.  

“What’s this for?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.  

“Homework,” she said with a grin.  

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “I think I’ve got enough homework, thanks.”  

“Not like this,” Maya said, her smile widening. “I want you to paint something—anything. It doesn’t have to be good. Just… something that feels like you.”  

Ethan hesitated, but the look in her eyes made it impossible to refuse. “Alright,” he said, tucking the canvas under his arm. “But don’t expect much.”  

“I never do,” Maya teased, her laughter following him out the door.

When Ethan got back to his dorm, he set the canvas on his desk and stared at it for what felt like hours.  

Maya made it look so easy—pouring her heart into her art, letting her emotions spill out onto the canvas. But for Ethan, it felt impossibly daunting.  

Still, he picked up the brush.  

At first, he wasn’t sure what he was doing. His strokes were hesitant, the colors clashing in ways that made him wince. But as he kept going, something shifted. He stopped thinking and just… painted.  

By the time he finished, the canvas was a chaotic swirl of blues and reds, streaked with lines of black and gold. It wasn’t perfect, but it was honest—an expression of everything he couldn’t put into words.  

As he sat back, exhaustion pulling at him, Ethan realized something surprising: for the first time in a long while, he felt lighter.  

And maybe, just maybe, he was starting to understand what Maya had been trying to teach him all along.
