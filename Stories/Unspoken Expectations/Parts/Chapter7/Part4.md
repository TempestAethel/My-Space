## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Maya stared at her phone, Ethan’s message glaring back at her like a spotlight on her insecurities.  

**“I think we need to take a step back. For real this time.”**  

The words felt like a slap, each one cutting deeper than the last. She wanted to scream, to throw her phone across the room, to erase the ache spreading through her chest. Instead, she set the phone down gently, her hands trembling.  

For a moment, she just sat there, her thoughts a tangled mess of anger, sadness, and confusion. Why did it feel like everyone in her life kept walking away?

As the hours passed, her emotions began to shift. The anger faded into something softer—something she didn’t want to name. She picked up her sketchbook, hoping to distract herself, but the blank page stared back at her, refusing to cooperate.  

With a sigh, she grabbed her phone and called Clara.  

“Hey,” Clara said, her voice warm but cautious. “What’s up?”  

Maya hesitated, her throat tightening. “Ethan wants to take a step back,” she said finally.  

There was a pause. “Oh,” Clara said softly. “How do you feel about that?”  

Maya laughed bitterly. “How do you think I feel? I hate it. I don’t understand why he keeps pulling away when all I’ve done is try to be there for him.”  

Clara was quiet for a moment. “Maya,” she said carefully, “have you thought about whether he might need space for himself? Maybe it’s not about you—it’s about what he’s going through.”  

Maya frowned, the words prickling at her defenses. “But I’ve been there for him,” she said. “I’ve tried so hard to make things work. Why isn’t that enough?”  

“Maybe it’s not about effort,” Clara said gently. “Maybe it’s about letting him figure things out without feeling like he has to answer to someone else.”  

Maya’s chest tightened, her mind racing. She wanted to argue, to defend herself, but deep down, a small voice whispered that Clara might be right.

The next day, Maya found herself walking aimlessly through the park, her thoughts a storm of conflicting emotions. She hated feeling like this—so untethered, so out of control.  

She sat down on a bench near the lake, pulling her coat tighter around her. Her mind drifted to her childhood, to the way her parents had always given her whatever she wanted. New toys, fancy vacations, endless praise—it had all come so easily.  

But what hadn’t come easily was learning how to handle disappointment. Whenever something didn’t go her way, her parents had smoothed it over, making sure she never had to face the uncomfortable reality of not getting what she wanted.  

Now, as an adult, she was realizing just how unprepared she was for moments like this.

Later that evening, Maya sat in her studio, staring at a half-finished painting. Her brush hovered over the canvas, her movements hesitant and uncertain.  

For so long, she’d poured her energy into seeking validation from others—her parents, her teachers, Ethan. She’d never stopped to think about what it would mean to validate herself.  

“What does it mean to just be me?” she thought, the question both terrifying and freeing.

Maya picked up her phone and opened her messages. She stared at Ethan’s name for a long time, her finger hovering over the keyboard.  

Finally, she typed:  

**Maya:** I’m sorry if I’ve made you feel like you couldn’t take the space you needed. I’ve been scared of losing you, but I think I need to figure out who I am without relying on you to make me feel whole.  

She stared at the message, her chest tightening. Then, before she could second-guess herself, she hit send.

The next morning, Maya woke to Ethan’s reply.  

**Ethan:** Thank you, Maya. That means a lot. I hope you find what you’re looking for.  

The message was simple, but it carried a weight that made her eyes sting with unshed tears.  

For the first time, she felt like she wasn’t just losing Ethan—she was letting go.  

And though it hurt, it also felt like the first step toward something new.
