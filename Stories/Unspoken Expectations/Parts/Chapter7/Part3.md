## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Ethan couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that had begun to creep into his interactions with Maya. At first, he thought he was imagining it—the subtle shifts in her tone, the way she twisted his words during their conversations.  

But the more time they spent together, the clearer it became.  

---

It started one evening when Maya called him, her voice unusually sharp.  

“You’ve been distant lately,” she said, skipping the pleasantries.  

Ethan frowned, caught off guard. “Maya, I’ve been busy. You know that.”  

“Too busy for me?” she shot back. “Because it feels like I’m the only one trying to keep this friendship alive.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “That’s not fair,” he said evenly. “I’ve been trying too, but I can’t drop everything every time you call.”  

Maya sighed heavily, her tone softening just enough to leave Ethan second-guessing himself. “I’m not asking you to drop everything, Ethan. I just… I don’t understand why you’re pushing me away.”  

“I’m not pushing you away,” Ethan said, though even as the words left his mouth, he wondered if she’d believe him.  

---

It wasn’t just her words—it was the way she made him feel, like he was constantly walking on eggshells. When he didn’t respond to her texts quickly enough, she’d accuse him of not caring. When he tried to set boundaries, she’d frame it as him being selfish or cold.  

“You used to be there for me,” she said one afternoon, her voice laced with disappointment. “What changed?”  

Ethan hesitated, the guilt creeping in even though he knew he hadn’t done anything wrong. “Nothing’s changed, Maya,” he said carefully. “I’m still here. I just need space too, and I think that’s okay.”  

But Maya shook her head, her expression pained. “It doesn’t feel okay. It feels like you don’t care anymore.”  

Ethan wanted to argue, to tell her how much he did care, but he could see it wouldn’t matter. No matter what he said, it wouldn’t be enough.  

---

Over time, Ethan began to notice patterns in Maya’s behavior—ways she deflected responsibility, turned the focus back on herself, and subtly manipulated situations to make him feel like he was in the wrong.  

It wasn’t until a conversation with Liam that he started to piece it together.  

“She’s not a bad person,” Ethan said, frustration evident in his tone. “But it’s like… every time I try to set a boundary, she finds a way to make me feel guilty about it.”  

Liam nodded thoughtfully. “Have you ever thought about why she does that?”  

Ethan frowned. “What do you mean?”  

“I don’t know Maya like you do,” Liam said, “but from what you’ve told me, it sounds like she’s used to getting her way. Maybe she doesn’t know how to handle someone telling her ‘no.’”  

The words hit Ethan harder than he expected.  

---

Maya had always talked about her childhood in vague, glowing terms—a life filled with luxuries, indulgent parents, and endless praise. But the more Ethan thought about it, the more he realized what was missing from those stories: accountability. Structure. Boundaries.  

She wasn’t parented—she was pampered.  

Her parents had given her everything she wanted but had never taught her how to cope with not getting her way. And now, as an adult, she struggled with rejection, with compromise, with the idea that other people’s needs might not always align with her own.  

---

The realization didn’t make Ethan angry—it made him sad. He could see the hurt behind Maya’s actions, the fear of losing control, the desperate need for validation.  

But it also made him more certain than ever that he couldn’t be the person to fix her.  

He cared about her deeply, but their relationship—whatever it had become—was starting to feel like a cycle he couldn’t escape.  

---

The next time Maya called, Ethan let it ring. When she texted a few hours later, asking why he hadn’t answered, he took a deep breath before replying:  

**Ethan:** I think we need to take a step back. For real this time.  

Her reply came quickly. **Maya:** What are you talking about? I thought we were past this.  

**Ethan:** Maya, I care about you, but I feel like we’re stuck in a pattern that isn’t healthy for either of us. I need time to figure things out, and I think you do too.  

There was a long pause before her next message: **Maya:** Wow. So you’re just giving up on me?  

Ethan’s chest tightened, but he forced himself to stay calm. **Ethan:** I’m not giving up. I’m just trying to do what’s best for both of us.  

---

That night, Ethan lay awake, staring at the ceiling. He hated hurting her, hated the thought of her feeling abandoned. But he also knew he couldn’t keep sacrificing his own peace for the sake of their relationship.  

Maya wasn’t a bad person—she was just someone who had a lot of growing to do. And maybe, so was he.  

For now, all he could do was hope that time and distance would bring them both the clarity they needed.
