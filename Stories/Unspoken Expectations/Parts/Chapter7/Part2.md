## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Maya’s texts came sparingly at first—casual, unassuming, like the way someone dips their toes into cold water before diving in.  

**Maya:** Hey, saw this funny meme and thought of you.  

Ethan stared at his phone, unsure how to respond. He knew Maya’s humor better than anyone, and the image did make him smile. But he also knew where this could lead.  

After a few minutes, he replied: **Ethan:** Haha, that’s a good one. Thanks for sharing.  

Short. Polite. Safe.  

Maya responded quickly. **Maya:** Miss our talks. Let’s catch up soon? Coffee maybe?  

Ethan frowned, the ache in his chest returning. He wanted to see her—of course he did—but he also knew how fragile the balance between them was.  

**Ethan:** Maybe sometime soon. Got a lot going on right now.

But Maya didn’t give up. A few days later, she called him unexpectedly.  

“Ethan!” Her voice was bright, almost too bright, as if she were trying to mask her nerves. “I was just thinking about that time we went hiking. Remember when you almost fell trying to take that ‘perfect picture’?”  

Ethan chuckled despite himself. “Yeah, I remember. You didn’t let me live that one down for weeks.”  

“Of course not,” Maya said, laughing. “It was hilarious!”  

For a moment, it felt like old times—the easy laughter, the warmth in her voice. But then Maya’s tone softened.  

“I miss this,” she said quietly.  

Ethan hesitated, the familiar ache settling in his chest. “Maya…”  

“I know, I know,” she said quickly, cutting him off. “I’m not trying to make things weird. I just… I miss having you in my life, even as a friend.”  

Ethan closed his eyes, her words tugging at his heart. “I miss you too,” he admitted.  

“Then let’s just be friends,” Maya said, her voice hopeful. “No pressure, no expectations. Just… us.”  

Ethan hesitated, then nodded. “Okay,” he said softly. “We can try that.”

For a while, it seemed to work. They met for coffee occasionally, their conversations light and easy. Maya sent him pictures of her paintings, and Ethan shared updates about his classes.  

But slowly, things began to shift.  

Maya started calling more often, her voice carrying a warmth that felt too familiar. She’d linger after their coffee meetups, finding excuses to spend more time with him.  

“Do you want to come by the studio?” she asked one afternoon. “I’d love to hear what you think about my new piece.”  

Ethan hesitated, glancing at the pile of work waiting for him back at his dorm. “Maybe another time,” he said.  

Maya’s smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. “Okay. But don’t forget—you promised.”  

---

It wasn’t just the frequency of her calls or the way she sought his attention—it was the way she looked at him, the way her touches lingered a moment too long.  

One evening, as they sat in the coffee shop, Maya reached across the table, her fingers brushing his. “You’ve always been so good at listening,” she said softly.  

Ethan pulled his hand back gently, pretending to adjust his cup. “I try,” he said lightly, deflecting the intensity in her gaze.  

---

Ethan found himself navigating a delicate balance—keeping Maya close enough to preserve their friendship, but not so close that it blurred the lines he’d been trying so hard to draw.  

When she asked to meet up more frequently, he started spacing out their meetings.  

When her texts became more frequent, he’d take longer to reply, keeping his responses brief but kind.  

He told himself it wasn’t avoidance—it was self-preservation.

Maya, however, seemed to sense the distance he was trying to create. One evening, as they walked through the park, she turned to him abruptly.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice trembling slightly, “are we okay?”  

Ethan stopped walking, his chest tightening. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean…” Maya hesitated, her eyes searching his. “It feels like you’re pulling away again. Like you’re keeping me at arm’s length.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the weight of her words pressing down on him. “Maya, I’m not trying to pull away. I just… I think we need to be careful. I don’t want to hurt you, and I don’t want us to fall back into something that neither of us is ready for.”  

Maya’s brow furrowed, her expression a mix of hurt and frustration. “So what, we’re just supposed to pretend we don’t mean anything to each other?”  

“That’s not what I’m saying,” Ethan said softly. “I care about you, Maya. I always will. But I think we need to respect the boundaries we set. For both of our sakes.”  

Maya looked away, her shoulders slumping. “I hate this,” she whispered.  

“I know,” Ethan said, his voice heavy with emotion. “I do too.”

That night, as Ethan lay in bed, he couldn’t stop thinking about the pain in her eyes. He hated hurting her, but he knew he was doing what was right—for both of them.  

And as much as he missed the way things used to be, he reminded himself that growth didn’t come from clinging to what was comfortable. It came from facing the hard truths and letting go when it mattered most.
