## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)  

Maya wasn’t ready to give up. A few days later, Ethan found a small envelope slipped under the door of his dorm room. Inside was a note written in her neat, slanted handwriting:

*Ethan,  
I know you think this is the right thing—for both of us. And maybe it is. But I also know that what we had was real, and it’s worth fighting for. If you’re willing to try, so am I.  
– Maya*

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed, the note trembling slightly in his hands. Her words tugged at his heart, making him question everything he’d tried so hard to convince himself of.  

For a moment, he imagined going to her studio, telling her he was ready to try again, that they could find a way to make it work. But then he remembered the countless late-night conversations, the misunderstandings, the weight of their expectations pulling them in different directions.  

He set the note on his desk, leaning back with a heavy sigh. “She deserves someone who doesn’t feel like this is a fight,” he thought.

The next day, Maya found Ethan in the library again. She didn’t say anything at first, just sat across from him, her sketchbook in hand.  

“I got your note,” Ethan said finally, breaking the silence.  

Maya glanced up, her eyes searching his face. “And?”  

Ethan hesitated, the words catching in his throat. “Maya, I—”  

“Don’t say you can’t,” she interrupted, her voice trembling. “Just tell me why. I need to know.”  

Ethan exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “Because I don’t think we can give each other what we need right now. I want to, Maya. I really do. But every time we try, it feels like we’re tearing each other apart instead of building each other up.”  

Maya looked away, her jaw tightening. “So that’s it?”  

“I don’t want it to be,” Ethan said softly. “But I think we both need to figure out who we are—what we want—before we can figure out if we’re meant to be together.”  

Maya was silent for a long time, her pencil hovering above the page in her sketchbook. Finally, she nodded, though her expression was filled with pain. “I hate that you’re probably right,” she said quietly.  

“I hate it too,” Ethan admitted.

When Maya left the library, Ethan stayed behind, staring blankly at the bookshelves. The ache in his chest was almost unbearable, but he reminded himself of the promise he’d made—to himself, to her.  

Letting her go wasn’t about giving up. It was about giving them both the space to grow into the people they were meant to be.  

And even though it hurt, he clung to the hope that one day, their paths might cross again—stronger, wiser, and ready for whatever came next.  

For now, all he could do was take it one step at a time.
