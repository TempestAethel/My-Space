## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Continued)

Ethan didn’t bring up the message again. He told himself it was because he didn’t want to pressure Maya, but the truth was more complicated. A part of him was afraid—afraid of pushing her too far and watching her pull away completely.  

He tried to focus on other things—his writing, his friends, the projects piling up as the semester neared its end. But no matter how busy he kept himself, thoughts of Maya lingered, creeping in during quiet moments.  

Was he expecting too much? Or was she giving too little? The questions circled endlessly in his mind, leaving him no closer to an answer.

Maya, meanwhile, found herself grappling with emotions she didn’t fully understand.  

She cared about Ethan—she always would—but their friendship had started to feel like a weight she couldn’t carry. Every time she saw his name on her phone screen, a knot of guilt formed in her chest.  

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to reply—it was that she didn’t know how. She didn’t know how to explain the growing distance between them without hurting him.  

But the truth was undeniable: she was moving on. Her life was changing, and the version of Ethan she’d once leaned on no longer fit into the person she was trying to become.  

---

A week later, they met again, this time at the park. It was Maya’s suggestion—a rare gesture that gave Ethan a glimmer of hope.  

They sat on the same bench where they’d shared so many conversations in the past, the early spring breeze carrying the scent of blooming flowers.  

“You’ve been quiet,” Ethan said after a while, breaking the silence.  

“Yeah,” Maya admitted, her gaze fixed on the ground. “I guess I’ve had a lot on my mind.”  

Ethan hesitated, then asked the question he’d been avoiding. “Are we okay, Maya?”  

She looked up at him, her expression unreadable. “I don’t know,” she said softly. “I feel like things have been… different.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “Different how?”  

Maya sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I guess I’ve been trying to figure out where I fit—in my life, in everything. And sometimes, it feels like I don’t have the energy to give you what you need.”  

Her words hung in the air, heavy and raw.  

“I’m not asking for much,” Ethan said quietly. “I just want to know where we stand.”  

Maya hesitated, then said, “I care about you, Ethan. I always will. But maybe we’ve been holding on to something that doesn’t work the way it used to.”  

---

Ethan nodded slowly, the weight of her words settling over him like a lead blanket. “So what happens now?”  

“I don’t know,” Maya admitted. “I think we need to figure out what this looks like—if it can work at all.”  

Ethan forced a small smile, though his heart ached. “I guess we’ll see.”  

They sat in silence after that, the distance between them feeling larger than the bench they shared.  

---

That evening, Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. He couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t enough—for Maya, for their friendship, for anything.  

The thought twisted in his chest, leaving him torn between anger and sadness. He wanted to believe he’d done his best, but the doubt lingered.  

Was he the problem? Or was this just the way things were meant to end?

Maya, too, felt the weight of their conversation as she sat in her studio later that night. She stared at her half-finished painting, the colors swirling together in chaotic strokes that mirrored her emotions.  

She hated feeling like this—like she was the one walking away, the one giving up. But deep down, she knew that staying in this limbo would only hurt them both.  

For the first time, she allowed herself to imagine a future without Ethan in it. The thought stung, but it also brought a strange sense of relief.  

Maybe it was time to let go.
