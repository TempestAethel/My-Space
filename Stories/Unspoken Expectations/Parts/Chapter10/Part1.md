## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles  

Ethan tapped his fingers nervously against the edge of his phone, rereading his last message to Maya.  

**Ethan:** Hey, how’s the new project going?  

It had been almost two hours since he’d sent it, and the silence on her end felt heavier than it should have. He reminded himself that Maya could just be busy, but the doubt lingered.  

It hadn’t always been this way.  

---

A week earlier, Maya had confronted him after one of their coffee meetups.  

“You’re not putting enough into this,” she said abruptly as they left the café.  

Ethan blinked, caught off guard. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, it feels like I’m the only one who’s trying sometimes,” Maya said, crossing her arms. “You don’t text me as much, and when we hang out, it’s like you’re just going through the motions.”  

Ethan frowned, guilt stirring in his chest. “Maya, that’s not true. I care about this friendship. I’m just trying to make sure we’re… balanced, you know? That we’re not slipping into old habits.”  

Maya sighed, looking away. “I just feel like you’re holding back. Like you’re afraid to really be here.”  

Ethan hesitated, the words hitting too close to home. “I’m not holding back,” he said carefully. “I’m just trying to be reasonable—for both of us.”  

Maya didn’t respond, her silence cutting deeper than any argument could.  

---

Since that conversation, Ethan had made an effort to reach out more, sending her messages, checking in, and even suggesting meetups. But something had shifted.  

Maya seemed distant, her replies short and infrequent. She canceled plans more often than not, always with a vague excuse about being busy.  

And now, as Ethan sat staring at his unanswered text, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d done something wrong—or if she was deliberately pulling away.  

---

A few days later, Ethan finally heard back from her.  

**Maya:** Sorry, been swamped with the exhibit stuff. What’s up?  

Her message was casual, almost dismissive, and it stung more than he wanted to admit.  

**Ethan:** Just wanted to check in. Let me know if you want to grab coffee soon.  

Her reply came an hour later: **Maya:** Maybe next week? I’ll let you know.  

Ethan sighed, setting his phone down. He couldn’t shake the feeling that their friendship was slipping into something uneven again. He was trying—wasn’t he? So why did it feel like she wasn’t?  

---

As the days passed, Ethan’s unease grew. He found himself second-guessing every interaction, every message he sent her.  

When she didn’t reply quickly, he wondered if she was ignoring him. When she did reply, her tone felt detached, almost obligatory.  

He tried to focus on other things—his writing, his classes, his friends—but the tension with Maya lingered like a shadow over everything.  

---

One evening, as Ethan sat in the library, Liam joined him, dropping into the seat across the table.  

“You look like you’re overthinking again,” Liam said, raising an eyebrow.  

Ethan sighed, running a hand through his hair. “It’s Maya. I feel like I’m trying to do everything right, but she’s pulling away, and I don’t know why.”  

Liam frowned thoughtfully. “Have you talked to her about it?”  

“I don’t want to start a fight,” Ethan admitted. “I just… I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if she’s actually ignoring me.”  

“Maybe she’s going through something,” Liam suggested. “Or maybe she doesn’t realize how it’s making you feel.”  

“Maybe,” Ethan said, though the doubt lingered.  

---

That night, Ethan decided to send her one more message.  

**Ethan:** Hey, hope everything’s okay. Just wanted to check in. No pressure, but let me know if you want to talk.  

Her reply came the next morning.  

**Maya:** Thanks, Ethan. I’m fine. Just busy.  

It was a perfectly reasonable response, but something about it felt off—like she was keeping him at arm’s length.  

For the first time, Ethan wondered if Maya was avoiding him intentionally—or if she simply didn’t value their friendship as much as he did.  

---

The uncertainty gnawed at him, leaving him torn between wanting to confront her and fearing the fallout of another confrontation.  

He cared about Maya deeply, but he couldn’t ignore the growing imbalance between them. Was he holding on too tightly? Or was she letting go too easily?  

And as he sat staring at his phone, waiting for a reply that might never come, Ethan couldn’t help but wonder if this new chapter in their friendship was destined to end before it had even truly begun.
