## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Continued)

Ethan checked his phone more times than he wanted to admit. Each time, the empty notification screen felt like a quiet rejection.  

It wasn’t until the next afternoon that Maya finally replied.  

**Maya:** Hey, sorry I’ve been so busy. We can talk if you want, but I’m not sure what you mean by “different.”  

Ethan read the message twice, trying to parse her words. Was she genuinely unaware, or was she deflecting? He couldn’t tell.  

Taking a deep breath, he typed out his reply.  

**Ethan:** I guess I’ve just felt some distance between us. I’m trying to keep things good between us, but it feels like something’s off.  

Maya’s response came quickly this time.  

**Maya:** I don’t know, Ethan. I’m fine. Maybe you’re overthinking things?  

Ethan frowned, her words stirring a mix of frustration and doubt. Was he overthinking? He’d spent so much time questioning himself lately that he couldn’t tell where his feelings ended and reality began.

Later that evening, Maya sat in her studio, staring at her phone. Ethan’s message lingered in her mind, a nagging weight she couldn’t shake.  

She cared about him—she did—but lately, their friendship had felt like an obligation rather than a comfort. She hated admitting it, even to herself, but she wasn’t sure if she had the energy to give him what he seemed to need.  

Her life was changing. The art exhibit she’d been working on was consuming most of her time, and she’d started spending more time with a new group of friends—people who didn’t know the complicated history she shared with Ethan.  

It wasn’t that she wanted to push him away, but being around him sometimes felt heavy, like a reminder of everything she was trying to move past.

For Ethan, the waiting was the hardest part. Maya’s short replies left him feeling more uncertain than ever, and the lack of clarity was starting to take its toll.  

He thought about the way things used to be—the easy laughter, the long conversations, the sense of mutual understanding. But that connection felt like a distant memory now, replaced by something fragile and strained.  

Liam’s words echoed in his mind: *“Maybe it’s time to stop guessing and just ask her.”*  

But he’d asked, hadn’t he? And her answers, vague as they were, hadn’t brought him any closer to understanding.  

Ethan found himself questioning not just their friendship, but himself. Was he too much? Too demanding? Or was he not enough?  

The uncertainty gnawed at him, leaving him stuck in a cycle of self-doubt.  

---

A few days later, Maya messaged him again.  

**Maya:** Hey, sorry if I’ve been distant. Things have just been crazy lately. Hope you’re doing okay.  

Ethan stared at the message, unsure how to respond. Her words felt polite but hollow, like they were meant to reassure him without addressing the deeper issues between them.  

He typed out a reply, deleted it, then typed another. Finally, he settled on something simple:  

**Ethan:** Thanks for checking in. I hope things settle down for you soon.  

The conversation ended there, the silence that followed more deafening than any argument.  

---

For the first time, Ethan started to wonder if this was how it would always be—an endless push and pull, where he was left chasing a connection that no longer felt mutual.  

And though he didn’t want to admit it, a small, painful part of him wondered if letting go was the only way to find peace.
