## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Continued)  

Days turned into weeks, and the gap between Ethan and Maya continued to grow. Despite his efforts to stay connected, Maya’s replies remained brief, her presence in his life feeling more like a flicker than a flame.  

Ethan found himself caught in a cycle of overthinking—replaying their conversations, analyzing her texts, and wondering if he was doing too much or not enough.  

One afternoon, as he walked across campus, he decided to visit the art building. Maybe seeing her in person would clear the air.

When Ethan arrived, the studio was buzzing with activity. Students worked on their projects, their voices a low hum in the background. Maya was near the back, her focus locked on a large canvas filled with bold, chaotic strokes.  

“Hey,” Ethan said, his voice tentative as he approached.  

Maya looked up, her expression briefly lighting up before settling into something more neutral. “Oh, hey. What are you doing here?”  

Ethan hesitated, suddenly feeling out of place. “I just wanted to check in. I haven’t seen you much lately.”  

Maya sighed, setting her brush down. “Yeah, sorry about that. Things have been… hectic.”  

“It’s okay,” Ethan said quickly, though the weight in his chest didn’t ease. “I just wanted to make sure everything’s alright.”  

“I’m fine,” Maya said, her tone clipped. “Just busy.”  

The words felt like a door closing, and Ethan nodded slowly, stepping back. “Alright. I’ll let you get back to it.”  

Maya gave him a small smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Thanks for stopping by.”

As Ethan walked back to his dorm, he replayed the interaction in his mind, trying to make sense of the distance between them. He’d expected the visit to bring clarity, but it only left him more confused.  

For the first time, he wondered if Maya truly wanted him in her life—or if she was keeping him around out of obligation.

That evening, Ethan vented to Liam over a game of pool in the student lounge.  

“She says she’s fine, but it doesn’t feel fine,” Ethan said, lining up his shot. “I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if she’s actually pulling away.”  

Liam leaned against the table, watching him carefully. “Have you told her how you feel?”  

Ethan shook his head. “No. I don’t want to make things worse. What if I’m overreacting?”  

“What if you’re not?” Liam countered. “You’re putting in the effort, Ethan. If she’s not meeting you halfway, maybe it’s time to figure out why.”  

Ethan sighed, sinking the ball into the pocket. “Easier said than done.”

Meanwhile, Maya sat alone in her studio, staring at her unfinished painting. Her conversation with Ethan earlier had left her unsettled, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on why.  

She cared about him deeply, but lately, she’d found herself withdrawing—not because she didn’t want him in her life, but because she didn’t know how to bridge the gap between them.  

Their friendship, as much as she valued it, felt fragile—like a delicate balance she wasn’t sure she could maintain.

A few days later, Maya finally reached out.  

**Maya:** Hey, want to grab coffee? My treat.  

Ethan stared at the message for a long moment before replying.  

**Ethan:** Sure. When?  

**Maya:** Tomorrow afternoon?  

**Ethan:** Sounds good.  

The next day, as they sat across from each other in the café, the air between them felt heavier than it had in weeks.  

“I’m sorry if I’ve been distant,” Maya said suddenly, her gaze fixed on her cup.  

Ethan looked up, surprised. “It’s okay. I figured you’ve been busy.”  

Maya hesitated, then shook her head. “It’s not just that. I think… I’ve been scared.”  

“Scared of what?” Ethan asked gently.  

“Of messing this up,” Maya admitted. “I don’t want to lose you, Ethan. But sometimes, it feels like I don’t know how to be your friend without… wanting more.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, and he took a deep breath before replying. “Maya, I care about you. But I think we need to be honest with each other about what this friendship looks like. Otherwise, we’re just going to keep hurting each other.”  

Maya nodded slowly, her expression conflicted. “You’re right. I just… I don’t know how to stop feeling like this.”  

Ethan hesitated, then reached across the table, his hand brushing hers briefly. “It’s okay to feel that way. But maybe it’s something we both need to figure out on our own.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “I don’t want to lose you,” she said again, her voice barely above a whisper.  

“You won’t,” Ethan said softly. “But we have to be honest with ourselves—and each other—if this is going to work.”

When they parted ways that afternoon, Ethan felt a strange mix of relief and uncertainty. They’d said the things that needed to be said, but the road ahead still felt murky, filled with questions he didn’t yet have answers for.  

As he walked back to his dorm, he couldn’t help but wonder if they were truly moving forward—or if they were just delaying the inevitable.
