## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Continued)  

A week after their conversation in the park, Ethan and Maya met for what felt like the last time—though neither of them dared to say it out loud. Maya had asked to meet at the coffee shop, her tone in the message neutral but unreadable.  

When Ethan arrived, she was already sitting at their usual table, her hands wrapped around a steaming cup of tea. She looked up as he approached, offering a small, tentative smile.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, sliding into the seat across from her.  

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The weight of all the unspoken words hung between them like a fog.

Maya broke the silence first, her gaze fixed on her cup. “I wanted to say thank you,” she said quietly.  

Ethan frowned, confused. “For what?”  

“For everything,” she said, looking up at him. “For always being there for me, even when I didn’t deserve it. You’ve been a better friend to me than I’ve been to you, and I just… I wanted you to know how much that means to me.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened, her words cutting through him in ways he hadn’t expected. “Maya, you’ve been a good friend too,” he said, though the words felt hollow.  

She shook her head. “I haven’t. Not really. I’ve been selfish, Ethan. I’ve taken you for granted, and I think… I think part of me was scared to admit that.”  

Ethan didn’t know what to say. A part of him wanted to argue, to reassure her that she wasn’t as bad as she thought. But another part of him—one he’d been trying to ignore—knew she was right.

“I think we’ve been holding on to something that doesn’t work anymore,” Maya said finally, her voice trembling. “And maybe it’s time we let it go.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the ache in his chest threatening to spill over. “Yeah,” he said softly. “Maybe you’re right.”  

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she gave him a small, sad smile. “You’re going to be okay, you know. You’re going to do amazing things.”  

“You too,” Ethan said, his voice thick with emotion. “I mean it, Maya. You’ve got so much ahead of you.”  

---

They sat in silence for a few more minutes, the reality of their parting sinking in. When they finally stood to leave, Maya reached out and hugged him tightly, her arms lingering around him for just a moment too long.  

“Take care of yourself, Ethan,” she said as they pulled apart.  

“You too,” he replied, his voice barely above a whisper.  

And with that, she walked away, her figure disappearing into the crowd outside the café.  

---

Ethan sat back down at the table, staring at the empty seat across from him. The bittersweet finality of their conversation hung heavy in the air, leaving him torn between relief and sadness.  

He didn’t know if he’d done the right thing, or if there even was a “right” thing to do. All he knew was that something had ended, and he was left to pick up the pieces.  

---

Maya, meanwhile, walked through the bustling streets, her mind a storm of emotions. She told herself she’d done what was best for both of them, but the ache in her chest refused to go away.  

As she turned the corner toward her studio, she glanced up at the sky, the fading sunlight casting the buildings in shades of gold and gray.  

“Maybe this is what moving on feels like,” she thought.  

But even as the thought crossed her mind, she couldn’t help but wonder if she’d lost something she would never truly find again.

That night, Ethan opened his journal and wrote:  

*“Letting go feels like breaking into pieces, but maybe it’s the only way to grow. I don’t know if I did the right thing, or if I could have done more. But for now, all I can do is keep moving forward and hope the pieces come back together someday.”*  

And as he closed the journal, the room quiet around him, Ethan allowed himself to hope that, in time, the ache would fade.  

Because sometimes, the hardest choices are the ones that lead to the most growth—even if they hurt.
