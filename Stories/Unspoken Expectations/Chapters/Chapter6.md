# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance  

The days that followed felt heavier for Ethan, each one blending into the next in a dull haze. The routines that had once grounded him now felt hollow, their meaning stripped away by the absence of Maya in his life.  

He found himself avoiding the places they used to go together—the coffee shop, the park, even the quiet corner of the library where they’d often study side by side. Everywhere he went, memories of her seemed to linger, refusing to fade.  

---

Maya, too, struggled to adjust. The studio, which had always been her sanctuary, now felt suffocating. Her paintings lacked the energy they once held, her brushstrokes hesitant and uncertain.  

She threw herself into her work anyway, hoping that the act of creating would quiet the ache in her chest. But no matter how many hours she spent painting, she couldn’t escape the feeling that something was missing.  

---

One evening, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the blank pages of the journal Maya had given him. The weight of his emotions felt too heavy to put into words, but he picked up his pen anyway, letting the thoughts spill out in messy, fragmented sentences.  

“I miss her. I miss the way she made everything feel brighter, lighter. I know we needed this space, but it feels like a part of me is missing. How do you move forward when you’re not sure where you’re going?”  

He set the pen down, closing the journal with a sigh.  

---

A few weeks later, Ethan ran into Maya by chance. It was late in the afternoon, and he was walking across campus when he spotted her coming out of the art building.  

She looked the same—her hair pulled into a loose braid, her bag slung over one shoulder—but there was something different about her. She seemed quieter, more subdued.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice soft as she stopped in front of him.  

“Maya,” he replied, his heart pounding at the sight of her.  

They stood there for a moment, an awkward silence stretching between them.  

“How have you been?” Maya asked finally.  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. “I’ve been… okay,” he said. “What about you?”  

Maya smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Same.”  

Another silence fell between them, and Ethan felt the weight of all the things he wanted to say pressing down on him.  

“I miss you,” he said suddenly, the words tumbling out before he could stop them.  

Maya’s eyes widened slightly, and for a moment, he thought she might say it back. But instead, she looked down, her expression pained.  

“I miss you too,” she said quietly. “But…”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “But what?”  

Maya met his gaze, her eyes filled with sadness. “I don’t know if we’re ready to go back to the way things were. Not yet.”  

Ethan nodded slowly, though her words felt like a punch to the gut. “I get it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya smiled faintly, her eyes glistening. “I hope you do.”  

With that, she turned and walked away, leaving Ethan standing there, the ache in his chest deeper than ever.  

---

That night, Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Her words echoed in his mind, and though they brought no clarity, they stirred a small, fragile hope.  

Maybe they weren’t ready yet.  

But maybe, someday, they would be.  

## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)  

The days after their brief encounter felt heavier for Ethan. Seeing Maya had stirred something deep within him—a mixture of longing, regret, and a quiet hope that he didn’t fully understand.  

He tried to bury himself in his work, hoping the routine would numb the ache in his chest. But no matter how many hours he spent studying or how many assignments he completed, his thoughts always seemed to wander back to her.  

---

Maya, too, found herself haunted by their conversation. She replayed it in her mind late at night, wondering if she’d made the right choice.  

She wanted to call him, to tell him how much she missed him, but something held her back. A quiet voice in the back of her mind reminded her why they’d needed the space in the first place.  

Instead, she turned to her art. Her paintings grew bolder, more expressive, as if she were trying to pour all her emotions onto the canvas. But even as the colors swirled and blended, she couldn’t escape the nagging feeling that something was missing.  

---

One afternoon, Ethan wandered into the library, hoping to find a quiet corner to clear his head. As he scanned the shelves, his eyes landed on a familiar book—a collection of poems that Maya had once lent him during their first semester together.  

Without thinking, he pulled it off the shelf and flipped through the pages. Her favorite poem was still marked with a small, folded corner, and as Ethan read the lines, he felt a pang of nostalgia.  

“Do you remember when we read this together?”  

Ethan turned, startled, to see Maya standing a few feet away. Her expression was soft, her gaze lingering on the book in his hands.  

“Yeah,” Ethan said, his voice quiet. “You said it reminded you of us.”  

Maya smiled faintly, stepping closer. “It still does.”  

They stood there for a moment, the weight of their shared memories pressing down on them.  

“How have you been?” Ethan asked finally, breaking the silence.  

Maya hesitated, then shrugged. “Better. I’ve been painting a lot.”  

Ethan nodded. “That’s good. I’m glad.”  

“What about you?” she asked, her voice tentative.  

“I’ve been… figuring things out,” Ethan said. “It’s not easy, but I’m trying.”  

Maya’s gaze softened, and she reached out, her fingers brushing against his. “I’m proud of you, Ethan. I hope you know that.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, but he managed a small smile. “Thanks.”  

---

That evening, as Ethan sat at his desk, he opened his journal and began to write:  

“She said she’s proud of me. I don’t know if I deserve it, but hearing those words felt like a lifeline. I’m still lost, but maybe that’s okay. Maybe being lost is part of the process. Maybe it means I’m still moving.”  

---

The next time Maya walked into her studio, she found a small envelope tucked under the door. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded neatly.  

She unfolded it slowly, her heart racing as she read the words:  

“You’ve always been my inspiration, Maya. I don’t know where this journey will take us, but I hope, someday, our paths cross again in the way they’re meant to. Until then, I’ll keep walking.”  

Tears filled her eyes as she clutched the note to her chest.  

Ethan was still out there, finding his way. And so was she.  

For now, that was enough.  

## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)  

The weeks that followed brought a strange kind of rhythm. Ethan and Maya no longer crossed paths regularly, but the echoes of their connection lingered in the spaces they’d once shared.  

Ethan began to focus more on himself, pushing past the fog of uncertainty that had clouded his mind for so long. He found himself spending more time journaling, not just about Maya, but about his own hopes and fears, the dreams he’d been too afraid to articulate.  

One evening, as he sat by the window of his dorm room, watching the snow fall softly outside, he wrote:  

“I’m starting to realize that letting go doesn’t mean forgetting. It means making room—for growth, for healing, for whatever comes next. I miss her, but maybe this space is what we both need to figure out who we really are.”  

---

Maya, too, was changing. The solitude of her studio, once a source of frustration and doubt, had become a place of discovery. Her paintings took on a new life, each one bolder and more unapologetic than the last.  

One day, as she stepped back to admire a finished piece, she realized it was unlike anything she’d ever created before. It was chaotic and raw, but it was hers—completely and unapologetically hers.  

For the first time in weeks, she felt a flicker of pride.  

---

Their mutual friends noticed the shift in both of them. Ethan seemed quieter, more introspective, while Maya radiated an intensity that was impossible to ignore.  

“Are you okay?” Ethan’s friend Liam asked one afternoon as they studied together in the library.  

Ethan hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah, I think so. It’s just… hard, you know? Figuring out who you are when you feel like a part of you is missing.”  

Liam frowned but didn’t press further. Instead, he offered a quiet reassurance: “You’ll get there, man. It just takes time.”  

Ethan smiled faintly, grateful for the support.  

---

Meanwhile, Maya found herself opening up to her roommate, Clara, during a late-night conversation in their dorm.  

“I feel like I’m finally starting to understand myself,” Maya admitted, her voice quiet. “But it’s lonely. I miss him.”  

Clara reached over, squeezing her hand. “Missing someone doesn’t mean you made the wrong choice. It just means they mattered.”  

Maya blinked back tears, nodding. “He does matter. More than I can put into words.”  

---

One evening, as Ethan walked through campus, he passed the art building and felt an inexplicable pull to go inside. The studio lights were dim, but as he wandered through the familiar halls, he saw one of Maya’s new paintings displayed on an easel near the back of the room.  

It was bold and vibrant, a swirling mix of colors and textures that seemed to radiate energy. Ethan stood there for a long time, taking it in, his chest tightening with a mix of pride and longing.  

“She’s incredible,” he thought.  

---

Maya, too, found herself thinking of Ethan in quiet moments—when she walked through the park they used to visit, or when she heard a song they’d once listened to together.  

But instead of feeling weighed down by the memories, she began to see them as a part of her story—something to cherish, even as she moved forward.  

---

By the time spring arrived, both Ethan and Maya had begun to settle into their new realities. They weren’t the same people they’d been when they first met, and they weren’t the same people they’d been when they’d said goodbye.  

But maybe that was okay.  

Because growth, they realized, wasn’t about staying the same. It was about becoming more—more honest, more resilient, and more open to the possibilities that lay ahead.  

And though their paths had diverged, there was a quiet, unspoken understanding between them: this wasn’t the end.  

It was simply a new beginning.  

## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)

Ethan sat alone in the library, his notes spread out in front of him but untouched. He tapped his pen against the notebook, the soft rhythm failing to distract him from the thought that had been haunting him for days. Maya had started texting again.

At first, it was small things—questions about their shared class or a passing comment about the campus coffee shop. But as the days went on, the messages became more personal.  

**Maya:** Saw a couple hiking today. Made me think of our trip.  

Ethan had stared at his phone for a long time after reading that one. He could feel the weight of her words, the longing hidden between the lines. But he didn’t reply. He didn’t trust himself to.  

---

Maya wasn’t one to give up easily, though. One afternoon, she waited outside the library, leaning against the stone wall with her arms crossed. When Ethan stepped outside, their eyes met.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

Ethan stopped in his tracks. “Maya,” he replied, his voice careful, guarded.  

“Can we talk?” she asked.  

He hesitated, torn between the pull of her presence and the resolve he’d been working so hard to maintain. “I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he said finally.  

Maya’s brow furrowed, but she didn’t look away. “Why not?”  

“Because we’ve been here before,” Ethan said, his voice low. “And it doesn’t end well. For either of us.”  

---

The words hung heavy between them, the space filled with unspoken emotions. Maya stepped closer, her expression earnest. “Ethan, I know things haven’t been perfect. But I miss you. I miss us.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I miss you too,” he admitted. “But missing each other isn’t enough. We keep hurting each other, Maya. And I don’t know how to fix that.”  

Maya’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, and she bit her lip, trying to find the right words. “I don’t want to lose you,” she whispered.  

“You’re not losing me,” Ethan said, his voice soft but firm. “We just… need to figure out who we are on our own first. Otherwise, we’ll keep falling into the same patterns.”  

---

Maya nodded slowly, though the sadness in her eyes didn’t fade. “I get it,” she said. “I don’t like it, but I get it.”  

Ethan smiled faintly, a bittersweet ache settling in his chest. “I care about you, Maya. I always will. But right now, I think we need to let go so we can grow.”  

Maya blinked back tears, her lips pressing into a thin line as she fought to keep her composure. “You’re braver than I am,” she said after a moment.  

Ethan shook his head. “I’m just trying to do what’s right. For both of us.”  

---

As Maya walked away, Ethan felt the familiar pang of longing, but he forced himself to stay rooted in the present. This wasn’t easy—it was one of the hardest things he’d ever done. But deep down, he knew it was necessary.

And as he turned back toward the library, he made a silent promise to himself: to keep moving forward, even when it hurt. Because sometimes, letting go was the only way to truly hold on—to hope, to growth, to the possibility of something better.  

## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)  

Maya wasn’t ready to give up. A few days later, Ethan found a small envelope slipped under the door of his dorm room. Inside was a note written in her neat, slanted handwriting:

*Ethan,  
I know you think this is the right thing—for both of us. And maybe it is. But I also know that what we had was real, and it’s worth fighting for. If you’re willing to try, so am I.  
– Maya*

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed, the note trembling slightly in his hands. Her words tugged at his heart, making him question everything he’d tried so hard to convince himself of.  

For a moment, he imagined going to her studio, telling her he was ready to try again, that they could find a way to make it work. But then he remembered the countless late-night conversations, the misunderstandings, the weight of their expectations pulling them in different directions.  

He set the note on his desk, leaning back with a heavy sigh. “She deserves someone who doesn’t feel like this is a fight,” he thought.  

---

The next day, Maya found Ethan in the library again. She didn’t say anything at first, just sat across from him, her sketchbook in hand.  

“I got your note,” Ethan said finally, breaking the silence.  

Maya glanced up, her eyes searching his face. “And?”  

Ethan hesitated, the words catching in his throat. “Maya, I—”  

“Don’t say you can’t,” she interrupted, her voice trembling. “Just tell me why. I need to know.”  

Ethan exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “Because I don’t think we can give each other what we need right now. I want to, Maya. I really do. But every time we try, it feels like we’re tearing each other apart instead of building each other up.”  

Maya looked away, her jaw tightening. “So that’s it?”  

“I don’t want it to be,” Ethan said softly. “But I think we both need to figure out who we are—what we want—before we can figure out if we’re meant to be together.”  

Maya was silent for a long time, her pencil hovering above the page in her sketchbook. Finally, she nodded, though her expression was filled with pain. “I hate that you’re probably right,” she said quietly.  

“I hate it too,” Ethan admitted.  

---

When Maya left the library, Ethan stayed behind, staring blankly at the bookshelves. The ache in his chest was almost unbearable, but he reminded himself of the promise he’d made—to himself, to her.  

Letting her go wasn’t about giving up. It was about giving them both the space to grow into the people they were meant to be.  

And even though it hurt, he clung to the hope that one day, their paths might cross again—stronger, wiser, and ready for whatever came next.  

For now, all he could do was take it one step at a time.
