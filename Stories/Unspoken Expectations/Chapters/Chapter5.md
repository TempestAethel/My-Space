# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads  

Returning to campus after their trip felt like stepping into a different world. The quiet serenity of the mountains was replaced by the hum of everyday life—classes, assignments, and the relentless pace of university.  

For Ethan, it was strange how quickly things fell back into routine. His days were once again filled with lectures and problem sets, his evenings spent in the library or his dorm. But something had shifted, and he couldn’t ignore it.  

Maya.  

The memory of their time together in the mountains lingered like a faint melody, playing in the back of his mind no matter where he was or what he was doing.  

---

A week after their return, Ethan found himself at the coffee shop, their usual spot. Maya was late—uncharacteristically so—and Ethan couldn’t help but feel a twinge of worry.  

When she finally arrived, her cheeks flushed from the cold, she slid into the seat across from him with a sheepish grin.  

“Sorry,” she said, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face. “Got caught up at the studio.”  

Ethan smiled, relieved. “No worries. Busy working on something new?”  

Maya nodded, her eyes lighting up. “Yeah, I’ve been experimenting with some ideas from the trip. It’s… different, but I think I’m onto something.”  

“That’s amazing,” Ethan said, his admiration for her growing. “I’d love to see it.”  

Maya’s smile softened. “Soon,” she said. “Once it’s ready.”  

---

Over the next few weeks, their lives fell back into their familiar rhythm, but with subtle differences. Their conversations felt deeper, more vulnerable, and Ethan found himself opening up to Maya in ways he hadn’t before.  

One evening, as they walked across campus after another long day, Maya turned to him with a thoughtful expression.  

“Do you ever feel like you’re standing at a crossroads?” she asked.  

Ethan frowned, glancing at her. “What do you mean?”  

“Like… you’re in this in-between place, trying to figure out where to go next,” she said. “And no matter which way you look, it feels like something’s pulling you in a different direction.”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her words striking a chord. “Yeah,” he said finally. “I feel like that a lot. Especially lately.”  

Maya nodded, her gaze distant. “Me too. It’s exciting, but also kind of terrifying.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “Whatever happens,” he said quietly, “you’re not alone in it. You know that, right?”  

Maya turned to him, her eyes soft. “I know,” she said. “And neither are you.”  

---

But as the semester progressed, the weight of their individual paths began to press down on them. Ethan buried himself in his coursework, trying to stay on top of his responsibilities, while Maya threw herself into her art, spending long hours at the studio.  

They still saw each other, still shared stolen moments of laughter and connection, but there was a tension growing between them—something unspoken that neither of them seemed ready to address.  

One evening, as they sat in the coffee shop, Ethan finally broke the silence.  

“Maya,” he said, his voice hesitant, “do you ever think about what’s next? After all of this?”  

Maya looked at him, her brow furrowing. “All the time,” she admitted. “But it’s hard to picture. There’s so much I want to do, so many places I want to go… but it feels so far away.”  

Ethan nodded, her words resonating deeply. “Yeah. I feel the same way.”  

For a moment, they just looked at each other, the weight of the future pressing down on them.  

But then Maya smiled, her eyes shimmering with quiet determination. “We’ll figure it out,” she said softly. “One step at a time.”  

Ethan smiled back, her words bringing a small measure of comfort. “Yeah,” he said. “We will.”  

And even though the road ahead felt uncertain, Ethan held on to the hope that whatever challenges they faced, they’d face them together.  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The following weeks were a blur of deadlines and late nights. Ethan threw himself into his coursework, the weight of upcoming exams and project submissions pressing heavily on him. Meanwhile, Maya became a ghost of herself, disappearing for long stretches into the studio.  

When they did manage to meet, their time together felt… different. The easy rhythm they’d shared after the trip seemed harder to hold onto, replaced by a quiet tension that neither of them wanted to name.  

---

One evening, Ethan found himself walking to the studio, the familiar ache of missing Maya pushing him to seek her out.  

When he arrived, the room was alive with color. Paintings in various stages of completion covered the walls, their bold, chaotic energy a stark contrast to the quiet focus of Maya herself.  

She didn’t notice him at first, her brush moving quickly across the canvas in front of her. Her hair was pulled into a messy bun, stray streaks of paint marking her hands and cheeks.  

“Maya,” Ethan said softly, not wanting to startle her.  

She looked up, her expression softening when she saw him. “Ethan. Hey.”  

“I figured I’d find you here,” he said, stepping closer.  

Maya smiled faintly, setting her brush down. “Yeah, I’ve been kind of… consumed by this lately. Sorry I’ve been MIA.”  

Ethan shook his head. “It’s okay. I get it. You’re working on something important.”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor. “It’s not just the work,” she admitted. “It’s everything. I feel like I’m trying so hard to hold it all together, but some days… I don’t know if I’m doing enough.”  

Ethan frowned, his chest tightening. “Maya, you’re incredible. The way you put your heart into everything you do—it’s inspiring. You don’t have to be perfect.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes shimmering. “Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot.”  

He stepped closer, his voice gentle. “You don’t have to go through this alone, you know. I’m here. Always.”  

For a moment, Maya didn’t say anything. Then she reached out, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug.  

“Thank you,” she whispered.  

Ethan held her close, the weight between them easing slightly.  

---

As they walked back to campus together that night, Maya glanced at him, her expression thoughtful.  

“Do you ever feel like you’re being pulled in two directions?” she asked.  

“All the time,” Ethan admitted.  

Maya nodded, her gaze distant. “I love what I’m doing here, but I can’t help thinking about everything I want to do after. All the places I want to see, all the things I want to create. It’s hard to balance that with… everything else.”  

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts swirling. “It’s not easy,” he said finally. “But I think you’re already doing it. You’re chasing what you love, and that’s what matters.”  

Maya smiled faintly. “What about you? What do you want?”  

Ethan was quiet for a moment, her question cutting through him like a blade. He’d been so focused on getting through each day, each assignment, that he hadn’t stopped to think about the bigger picture.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But I know I want to figure it out. And I think… I think I want you to be part of that.”  

Maya stopped walking, turning to face him. “Ethan…”  

Her voice was soft, unsure, and for a moment, Ethan thought he might have said too much. But then she smiled, her eyes warm.  

“Me too,” she said.  

Ethan exhaled, the weight in his chest easing.  

---

Later that night, as Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, he thought about Maya’s words—the way she talked about being pulled in two directions, the way her eyes had softened when she said she wanted him to be part of her future.  

It wasn’t a solution, not yet. But it was a step.  

And for now, that was enough.  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The quiet days that followed brought more reflection than resolution. Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that something was shifting—not just between him and Maya, but within himself.  

One evening, as he sat in the library trying to focus on his notes, his phone buzzed with a message from her.  

**Maya:** Coffee tomorrow?  

The simple text sent a wave of relief through him.  

**Ethan:** Always.  

---

The café was quiet the next afternoon, the soft hum of conversation and clinking of cups creating a cozy backdrop. Ethan arrived early, choosing a table by the window and ordering Maya’s favorite drink—an almond milk latte.  

When she walked in, her eyes scanned the room before landing on him. She smiled, the tension in her face softening as she slid into the seat across from him.  

“Hey,” she said.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, pushing the cup toward her.  

Maya’s grin widened as she took it. “You remembered.”  

“Of course,” Ethan said lightly.  

For a few minutes, they talked about small things—the weather, their classes, the latest drama in their friend group. But eventually, the conversation took a more serious turn.  

“I’ve been thinking,” Maya said, wrapping her hands around her cup.  

“About what?” Ethan asked, leaning forward.  

“About us,” she said softly.  

Ethan’s heart skipped a beat. “What about us?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table. “I feel like we’re at a crossroads, Ethan. Like we’re trying to figure out who we are—individually and together. And it’s… hard.”  

Ethan nodded, his throat tightening. “Yeah, it is. But I think that’s normal, right? We’re both figuring things out.”  

Maya looked up, her eyes searching his. “I know. But sometimes, I feel like I’m asking too much of you. Like I expect you to understand me in ways I don’t even understand myself.”  

Ethan reached across the table, his hand brushing hers. “Maya, you’re not asking too much. I’m here because I want to be. Even when it’s hard.”  

She smiled faintly, though the tension in her expression didn’t fully ease. “Thank you,” she said.  

---

Later, as they walked back to campus together, Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that Maya’s words had been a plea—a quiet hope that he could meet her where she was, even if neither of them knew exactly what that meant.  

And as they parted ways for the evening, Ethan found himself wondering if he could really be the person she needed—or if trying to be that person would mean losing himself in the process.  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The next few days felt like a balancing act Ethan wasn’t sure he could maintain.  

His time with Maya was still filled with laughter and warmth, but there was an undercurrent of something heavier—something unspoken that neither of them seemed ready to confront.  

Maya continued to pour herself into her art, disappearing for hours at a time into the studio. Ethan, meanwhile, tried to keep himself grounded in his coursework, but his thoughts often drifted back to her.  

---

One evening, Maya called him, her voice softer than usual.  

“Hey,” she said.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, his chest tightening at the sound of her.  

“Can we talk?” she asked. “I mean, really talk?”  

“Of course,” Ethan said, already grabbing his coat. “Where are you?”  

“The studio,” she said.  

“I’m on my way.”  

---

When Ethan arrived, the studio was quieter than usual, the faint hum of music in the background barely audible. Maya was sitting on the floor, surrounded by half-finished canvases and jars of paint.  

She looked up as he entered, her expression unreadable.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, closing the door behind him. “What’s going on?”  

Maya hesitated, then gestured for him to sit beside her.  

For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then, finally, Maya broke the silence.  

“I’ve been thinking a lot about us,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.  

Ethan’s heart pounded. “Okay…”  

Maya looked down at her hands, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her sweater. “I care about you, Ethan. More than I can put into words. But sometimes… I feel like I’m asking you to carry more than you should have to.”  

Ethan frowned, his chest tightening. “Maya, you’re not asking too much. I want to be here for you.”  

“I know,” she said quickly. “And I love that about you. But I also know how hard this is for you—how hard it’s been for both of us. And I don’t want to hurt you by expecting you to be someone you’re not.”  

Ethan shook his head, his voice steady. “You’re not hurting me, Maya. You make me want to be better. You make me want to try.”  

Maya smiled faintly, though her eyes were still filled with uncertainty. “I just don’t want us to lose ourselves in the process.”  

Ethan reached out, his hand brushing against hers. “We won’t,” he said firmly. “As long as we’re honest with each other, we’ll figure it out.”  

Maya met his gaze, her eyes shimmering. “I hope so,” she said softly.  

---

That night, as Ethan walked back to his dorm, her words echoed in his mind.  

He wanted to believe they could find a way through this—that their connection was strong enough to weather the uncertainties and challenges they faced.  

But for the first time, he couldn’t ignore the small, nagging doubt creeping into the back of his mind.  

What if love wasn’t enough?  

And what would happen if they couldn’t find their way back to the simplicity they’d once shared?  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The next morning, Ethan woke with a heaviness in his chest that he couldn’t shake. Maya’s words from the night before played on repeat in his mind, and though he wanted to believe they could figure things out, the weight of their unspoken struggles lingered.  

By the time he arrived at their usual coffee shop, Maya was already there, a steaming cup in front of her and her sketchbook open to a blank page. She looked up as he approached, her smile warm but tinged with something Ethan couldn’t quite place.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, sliding into the seat across from her.  

For a while, they fell into their usual rhythm—talking about classes, friends, and whatever random topic came to mind. But beneath the surface, Ethan could feel the tension brewing, like a storm waiting to break.  

Eventually, Maya set her pencil down and looked at him, her expression hesitant.  

“Can I ask you something?” she said.  

“Of course,” Ethan said, though the tightness in his chest returned.  

“Do you ever feel like… like we’re trying too hard?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.  

Ethan froze, her words hitting him like a punch to the gut. “What do you mean?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table. “I don’t know,” she said finally. “It’s just… I love being with you, Ethan. I really do. But sometimes it feels like we’re both carrying so much—like we’re trying to be everything for each other, and it’s… heavy.”  

Ethan stared at her, his mind racing. “Maya, I—”  

She looked up, her eyes shimmering. “I’m not saying I want to give up,” she said quickly. “I just… I don’t know how to make it easier. For either of us.”  

Ethan exhaled, his shoulders slumping. “I don’t either,” he admitted. “But I don’t want to lose this. I don’t want to lose you.”  

Maya reached across the table, her hand brushing his. “You’re not going to lose me,” she said softly. “I just think we need to figure out what this looks like for us. Without all the pressure.”  

Ethan nodded, though her words left him with more questions than answers.  

---

That evening, as Ethan walked back to his dorm, he found himself replaying their conversation over and over.  

Maya’s honesty was one of the things he loved most about her, but it was also one of the hardest things to face. She wasn’t wrong—things *had* felt heavier lately. And while he didn’t want to admit it, a part of him wondered if they were trying to hold on to something that was slipping through their fingers.  

---

A few days later, they met again, this time at Maya’s studio.  

Ethan watched as she worked, her brush moving in quick, confident strokes across the canvas. There was something hypnotic about the way she created, as if she were pouring her entire soul into her art.  

But as he watched, a quiet thought crept into his mind: what if this was what Maya needed most—this space, this freedom to create—more than anything he could give her?  

“You’re amazing, you know that?” Ethan said suddenly, his voice breaking the silence.  

Maya paused, glancing at him with a small smile. “You’ve told me before.”  

“Well, it’s true,” he said, his chest tightening.  

She set down her brush and crossed the room to sit beside him. “You’re pretty amazing too, you know,” she said, nudging him gently.  

Ethan smiled faintly, though the weight in his chest didn’t ease.  

For the rest of the evening, they talked and laughed, their connection feeling lighter than it had in weeks. But as Ethan left the studio that night, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were standing on the edge of something they couldn’t quite see.  

---

In the days that followed, the distance between them began to grow—not physically, but emotionally. Their conversations became shorter, their silences longer.  

Ethan told himself it was just a rough patch, that they’d find their way back to each other. But deep down, he couldn’t ignore the quiet fear creeping into his heart.  

Because for the first time, he wondered if love alone would be enough to keep them together.  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The next week passed in a blur of routines and responsibilities. Ethan and Maya still saw each other, but the space between them seemed to stretch further with every passing day.  

Ethan noticed the small changes first—the way Maya’s texts became shorter, her replies slower. When they were together, she seemed distracted, her mind somewhere else even when she smiled at him.  

He tried to ignore it, to chalk it up to stress or exhaustion. But the truth lingered in the back of his mind, no matter how much he tried to push it away: something was shifting, and he didn’t know how to stop it.  

---

One evening, as they sat in the coffee shop, Maya broke the silence that had settled between them.  

“Ethan,” she said softly, her hands wrapped around her cup, “I feel like we’re not talking the way we used to.”  

Ethan froze, his heart sinking. “What do you mean?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table. “I don’t know. It’s like… we’re here, but we’re not really here. Does that make sense?”  

Ethan nodded slowly, his chest tightening. “Yeah, it does.”  

Maya sighed, her shoulders slumping. “I hate feeling this way. I hate that we’re… struggling.”  

“We can fix it,” Ethan said quickly, his voice firm. “We just need to figure out what’s going wrong.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes filled with uncertainty. “I don’t think it’s about something going wrong, Ethan. I think it’s just… life. We’re both carrying so much, and it’s hard to make space for each other the way we used to.”  

Ethan’s throat tightened, her words cutting deeper than he expected. “So what are you saying?”  

“I’m saying I don’t know what to do,” she said quietly. “I don’t know how to make this easier.”  

Ethan reached across the table, his hand brushing hers. “We’ll figure it out,” he said softly. “We always do.”  

Maya nodded, but the doubt in her eyes remained.  

---

That night, as Ethan lay in bed, her words echoed in his mind.  

For so long, their relationship had been his anchor—the one constant in a world that often felt overwhelming and uncertain. But now, the very thing that had grounded him felt like it was slipping away, and he didn’t know how to hold on.  

He thought about the way Maya had looked at him earlier, the sadness in her eyes, and wondered if she was feeling the same ache he was.  

But more than that, he wondered if they were strong enough to survive it.  

---

The following weekend, Maya invited him to her studio. Ethan went, hoping for some semblance of normalcy, but the moment he walked through the door, he could feel the tension hanging in the air.  

Maya was sitting on the floor, her back against the wall and her sketchbook balanced on her knees. She looked up when he entered, her smile small and hesitant.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, closing the door behind him. “What’s up?”  

Maya gestured for him to sit beside her. “I just… needed to talk.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened, his pulse quickening. “Okay. What’s on your mind?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze fixed on the sketchbook in her lap. “Ethan, I care about you so much. You know that, right?”  

“Of course I do,” Ethan said, his voice steady despite the unease creeping in.  

She looked at him, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “But I don’t know if what we’re doing is fair. To either of us.”  

Ethan felt like the ground had been pulled out from under him. “What are you saying?”  

“I’m saying I think we need to take a step back,” she said, her voice breaking. “Not because I don’t love you, but because I do. And I don’t want us to keep hurting each other by trying to force something that isn’t working right now.”  

Ethan stared at her, his chest tight and his mind racing. “Maya, we can fix this. We just need time—”  

Maya shook her head, tears slipping down her cheeks. “I’ve been telling myself that too, Ethan. But I think we both know this isn’t something we can fix by pretending everything’s okay.”  

Ethan’s throat burned, the weight of her words crashing down on him. “So this is it?”  

Maya reached for his hand, her grip trembling. “I don’t want it to be. But maybe we need to figure out who we are on our own before we can figure out who we are together.”  

Ethan looked at her, his vision blurring as tears filled his eyes. “I don’t want to lose you,” he whispered.  

“You’re not losing me,” she said, her voice firm despite her tears. “But I think we need this. For us.”  

---

When Ethan left the studio that night, the air felt colder than it had in weeks. The ache in his chest was overwhelming, the weight of their conversation pressing down on him like a heavy blanket.  

He didn’t know what the future held—if they’d find their way back to each other or if this was the beginning of the end.  

But as he walked across campus, his mind replaying her words, he knew one thing for certain: letting her go, even temporarily, was the hardest thing he’d ever done.  

## Chapter 5: Crossroads (Continued)  

The days after the conversation at the studio felt like a blur. Ethan went through the motions of his routines—attending classes, completing assignments, and meeting deadlines—but everything felt hollow.  

Maya’s absence was palpable, a void he couldn’t ignore no matter how hard he tried. He hadn’t realized how much of his life had revolved around her until she wasn’t there anymore.  

Their usual coffee shop meetings stopped. The late-night texts that had once been a comforting constant were replaced by silence.  

For the first time since they’d met, Ethan felt truly alone.  

---

Maya, too, was struggling. She threw herself into her art with a single-minded intensity, spending hours in the studio until exhaustion forced her to stop.  

But even as she painted, her thoughts kept drifting back to Ethan—the way he’d looked at her that night, the hurt in his eyes as he tried to understand why she was pulling away.  

She hated herself for causing him pain, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that this was the right thing to do.  

---

A week after their conversation, Ethan found himself sitting on a bench near the park, staring blankly at the frozen pond. The crisp winter air bit at his skin, but he barely noticed.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket, and for a brief, fleeting moment, he hoped it was Maya. But when he checked, it was just a reminder for an upcoming exam.  

He sighed, leaning back against the bench and running a hand through his hair.  

“Ethan?”  

The sound of her voice made him freeze.  

He turned to see Maya standing a few feet away, her hands tucked into the pockets of her coat and her cheeks pink from the cold.  

“Hey,” he said softly, his heart pounding.  

“Hey,” she replied, stepping closer. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”  

“Yeah, I just… needed some air,” Ethan said, gesturing vaguely at the park. “What about you?”  

Maya hesitated, then shrugged. “Same.”  

For a moment, neither of them spoke, the silence between them heavy with everything they weren’t saying.  

Finally, Maya broke the tension. “How are you?” she asked, her voice quiet.  

Ethan smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “I’ve been better.”  

Maya’s expression softened, and she looked down at the ground. “Me too.”  

---

They sat down on the bench together, the silence stretching out once again. But this time, it felt less suffocating—like they were both trying to find the right words.  

“I miss you,” Ethan said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya’s breath hitched, and she looked at him, her eyes shimmering. “I miss you too.”  

Ethan turned to face her fully, his chest tightening. “Then why does it feel like we’re drifting further apart?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to her hands. “Because we are,” she said softly. “And I hate it. But I think we both need to figure out who we are without leaning on each other so much.”  

Ethan’s throat tightened, but he nodded. “I just don’t know how to do that,” he admitted.  

“Neither do I,” Maya said, her voice trembling. “But I think we have to try. For both of us.”  

Ethan exhaled, his breath forming a cloud in the cold air. “Do you think we’ll ever find our way back to each other?”  

Maya looked at him, her expression filled with a mix of hope and sadness. “I don’t know,” she said honestly. “But I hope so.”  

---

When they parted ways, Ethan felt a strange mix of emotions—sadness, frustration, and a small, fragile glimmer of hope.  

He didn’t know what the future held or if they could ever repair what had been broken. But as he watched her walk away, he knew one thing for sure: no matter what happened, she would always be a part of him.  

And for now, that would have to be enough.
