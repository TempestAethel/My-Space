# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness  

Ethan woke to the sound of rain tapping softly against his window. The gray morning light filtered through the curtains, matching the quiet heaviness that had settled in his chest.  

It had been two weeks since he’d last spoken to Maya, and though the ache of her absence hadn’t faded, it had started to feel… familiar. Like a dull hum in the background of his days, constant but manageable.  

He pulled his journal from the bedside table, flipping to the next blank page.  

*“There’s a strange kind of stillness in my life now. It’s not comfortable, but it’s not unbearable either. I miss her, but I think I’m finally starting to understand why we needed this. Growth doesn’t happen in the safety of what we know. It happens in the spaces we don’t want to face.”*  

He closed the journal with a soft sigh, setting it back down.

Maya, too, had begun to find moments of clarity amidst the chaos of her emotions. She spent more time alone, wandering through the park or sitting by the lake with her sketchbook. Her art had shifted again, becoming less about capturing what she saw and more about expressing what she felt.  

One afternoon, as she added the final strokes to a painting, she stepped back and realized it was the most honest thing she’d ever created.  

It was messy and imperfect—a swirling blend of colors that seemed to echo the conflict in her heart. But it was real, and for the first time in weeks, she felt a sense of peace.  

---

Their friends noticed the changes in both of them.  

“Have you talked to Maya?” Liam asked Ethan one evening as they walked back from class.  

Ethan shook his head. “No. I think we both need space right now.”  

Liam nodded, though he didn’t look convinced. “You still care about her, though, right?”  

“Of course I do,” Ethan said, his voice firm. “But caring about someone doesn’t always mean being with them. Sometimes it means letting them go.”  

---

Meanwhile, Clara found herself trying to cheer Maya up during their late-night conversations.  

“You’re doing great,” Clara said, watching as Maya stared at the painting she’d just finished. “This is incredible.”  

“Thanks,” Maya said softly. “But it still feels like something’s missing.”  

Clara frowned. “Do you think it’s Ethan?”  

Maya hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor. “Maybe. But I think it’s more than that. I think it’s me. I’m still figuring out who I am without him.”  

“And that’s okay,” Clara said gently. “It’s going to take time, but you’ll get there.”  

Maya smiled faintly, though the uncertainty in her eyes remained.  

---

One evening, as Ethan walked through the park, he found himself stopping by the bench where he and Maya had sat during their last conversation. The memory of her words lingered in the air, bittersweet and raw.  

For a moment, he closed his eyes, letting the cool breeze wash over him.  

“I hope you’re doing okay, Maya,” he thought silently.  

---

Across campus, Maya sat in her studio, staring at the blank canvas in front of her. She picked up her brush, hesitated, then set it back down.  

Her thoughts drifted to Ethan, to the way he’d looked at her that day in the library. She wondered if he was thinking about her too, if he missed her the way she missed him.  

But instead of reaching for her phone, she reached for her brush again.  

Because for now, this was where she needed to be—in the quiet stillness of herself, finding her own way forward.  

---

And though neither of them said it out loud, they both carried the same quiet hope: that someday, when the time was right, their paths might cross again.  

For now, they would walk their separate journeys, growing stronger with each step.  

## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Maya’s texts came sparingly at first—casual, unassuming, like the way someone dips their toes into cold water before diving in.  

**Maya:** Hey, saw this funny meme and thought of you.  

Ethan stared at his phone, unsure how to respond. He knew Maya’s humor better than anyone, and the image did make him smile. But he also knew where this could lead.  

After a few minutes, he replied: **Ethan:** Haha, that’s a good one. Thanks for sharing.  

Short. Polite. Safe.  

Maya responded quickly. **Maya:** Miss our talks. Let’s catch up soon? Coffee maybe?  

Ethan frowned, the ache in his chest returning. He wanted to see her—of course he did—but he also knew how fragile the balance between them was.  

**Ethan:** Maybe sometime soon. Got a lot going on right now.  

---

But Maya didn’t give up. A few days later, she called him unexpectedly.  

“Ethan!” Her voice was bright, almost too bright, as if she were trying to mask her nerves. “I was just thinking about that time we went hiking. Remember when you almost fell trying to take that ‘perfect picture’?”  

Ethan chuckled despite himself. “Yeah, I remember. You didn’t let me live that one down for weeks.”  

“Of course not,” Maya said, laughing. “It was hilarious!”  

For a moment, it felt like old times—the easy laughter, the warmth in her voice. But then Maya’s tone softened.  

“I miss this,” she said quietly.  

Ethan hesitated, the familiar ache settling in his chest. “Maya…”  

“I know, I know,” she said quickly, cutting him off. “I’m not trying to make things weird. I just… I miss having you in my life, even as a friend.”  

Ethan closed his eyes, her words tugging at his heart. “I miss you too,” he admitted.  

“Then let’s just be friends,” Maya said, her voice hopeful. “No pressure, no expectations. Just… us.”  

Ethan hesitated, then nodded. “Okay,” he said softly. “We can try that.”  

---

For a while, it seemed to work. They met for coffee occasionally, their conversations light and easy. Maya sent him pictures of her paintings, and Ethan shared updates about his classes.  

But slowly, things began to shift.  

Maya started calling more often, her voice carrying a warmth that felt too familiar. She’d linger after their coffee meetups, finding excuses to spend more time with him.  

“Do you want to come by the studio?” she asked one afternoon. “I’d love to hear what you think about my new piece.”  

Ethan hesitated, glancing at the pile of work waiting for him back at his dorm. “Maybe another time,” he said.  

Maya’s smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. “Okay. But don’t forget—you promised.”  

---

It wasn’t just the frequency of her calls or the way she sought his attention—it was the way she looked at him, the way her touches lingered a moment too long.  

One evening, as they sat in the coffee shop, Maya reached across the table, her fingers brushing his. “You’ve always been so good at listening,” she said softly.  

Ethan pulled his hand back gently, pretending to adjust his cup. “I try,” he said lightly, deflecting the intensity in her gaze.  

---

Ethan found himself navigating a delicate balance—keeping Maya close enough to preserve their friendship, but not so close that it blurred the lines he’d been trying so hard to draw.  

When she asked to meet up more frequently, he started spacing out their meetings.  

When her texts became more frequent, he’d take longer to reply, keeping his responses brief but kind.  

He told himself it wasn’t avoidance—it was self-preservation.  

---

Maya, however, seemed to sense the distance he was trying to create. One evening, as they walked through the park, she turned to him abruptly.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice trembling slightly, “are we okay?”  

Ethan stopped walking, his chest tightening. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean…” Maya hesitated, her eyes searching his. “It feels like you’re pulling away again. Like you’re keeping me at arm’s length.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the weight of her words pressing down on him. “Maya, I’m not trying to pull away. I just… I think we need to be careful. I don’t want to hurt you, and I don’t want us to fall back into something that neither of us is ready for.”  

Maya’s brow furrowed, her expression a mix of hurt and frustration. “So what, we’re just supposed to pretend we don’t mean anything to each other?”  

“That’s not what I’m saying,” Ethan said softly. “I care about you, Maya. I always will. But I think we need to respect the boundaries we set. For both of our sakes.”  

Maya looked away, her shoulders slumping. “I hate this,” she whispered.  

“I know,” Ethan said, his voice heavy with emotion. “I do too.”  

---

That night, as Ethan lay in bed, he couldn’t stop thinking about the pain in her eyes. He hated hurting her, but he knew he was doing what was right—for both of them.  

And as much as he missed the way things used to be, he reminded himself that growth didn’t come from clinging to what was comfortable. It came from facing the hard truths and letting go when it mattered most.  

## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Ethan couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that had begun to creep into his interactions with Maya. At first, he thought he was imagining it—the subtle shifts in her tone, the way she twisted his words during their conversations.  

But the more time they spent together, the clearer it became.  

---

It started one evening when Maya called him, her voice unusually sharp.  

“You’ve been distant lately,” she said, skipping the pleasantries.  

Ethan frowned, caught off guard. “Maya, I’ve been busy. You know that.”  

“Too busy for me?” she shot back. “Because it feels like I’m the only one trying to keep this friendship alive.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “That’s not fair,” he said evenly. “I’ve been trying too, but I can’t drop everything every time you call.”  

Maya sighed heavily, her tone softening just enough to leave Ethan second-guessing himself. “I’m not asking you to drop everything, Ethan. I just… I don’t understand why you’re pushing me away.”  

“I’m not pushing you away,” Ethan said, though even as the words left his mouth, he wondered if she’d believe him.  

---

It wasn’t just her words—it was the way she made him feel, like he was constantly walking on eggshells. When he didn’t respond to her texts quickly enough, she’d accuse him of not caring. When he tried to set boundaries, she’d frame it as him being selfish or cold.  

“You used to be there for me,” she said one afternoon, her voice laced with disappointment. “What changed?”  

Ethan hesitated, the guilt creeping in even though he knew he hadn’t done anything wrong. “Nothing’s changed, Maya,” he said carefully. “I’m still here. I just need space too, and I think that’s okay.”  

But Maya shook her head, her expression pained. “It doesn’t feel okay. It feels like you don’t care anymore.”  

Ethan wanted to argue, to tell her how much he did care, but he could see it wouldn’t matter. No matter what he said, it wouldn’t be enough.  

---

Over time, Ethan began to notice patterns in Maya’s behavior—ways she deflected responsibility, turned the focus back on herself, and subtly manipulated situations to make him feel like he was in the wrong.  

It wasn’t until a conversation with Liam that he started to piece it together.  

“She’s not a bad person,” Ethan said, frustration evident in his tone. “But it’s like… every time I try to set a boundary, she finds a way to make me feel guilty about it.”  

Liam nodded thoughtfully. “Have you ever thought about why she does that?”  

Ethan frowned. “What do you mean?”  

“I don’t know Maya like you do,” Liam said, “but from what you’ve told me, it sounds like she’s used to getting her way. Maybe she doesn’t know how to handle someone telling her ‘no.’”  

The words hit Ethan harder than he expected.  

---

Maya had always talked about her childhood in vague, glowing terms—a life filled with luxuries, indulgent parents, and endless praise. But the more Ethan thought about it, the more he realized what was missing from those stories: accountability. Structure. Boundaries.  

She wasn’t parented—she was pampered.  

Her parents had given her everything she wanted but had never taught her how to cope with not getting her way. And now, as an adult, she struggled with rejection, with compromise, with the idea that other people’s needs might not always align with her own.  

---

The realization didn’t make Ethan angry—it made him sad. He could see the hurt behind Maya’s actions, the fear of losing control, the desperate need for validation.  

But it also made him more certain than ever that he couldn’t be the person to fix her.  

He cared about her deeply, but their relationship—whatever it had become—was starting to feel like a cycle he couldn’t escape.  

---

The next time Maya called, Ethan let it ring. When she texted a few hours later, asking why he hadn’t answered, he took a deep breath before replying:  

**Ethan:** I think we need to take a step back. For real this time.  

Her reply came quickly. **Maya:** What are you talking about? I thought we were past this.  

**Ethan:** Maya, I care about you, but I feel like we’re stuck in a pattern that isn’t healthy for either of us. I need time to figure things out, and I think you do too.  

There was a long pause before her next message: **Maya:** Wow. So you’re just giving up on me?  

Ethan’s chest tightened, but he forced himself to stay calm. **Ethan:** I’m not giving up. I’m just trying to do what’s best for both of us.  

---

That night, Ethan lay awake, staring at the ceiling. He hated hurting her, hated the thought of her feeling abandoned. But he also knew he couldn’t keep sacrificing his own peace for the sake of their relationship.  

Maya wasn’t a bad person—she was just someone who had a lot of growing to do. And maybe, so was he.  

For now, all he could do was hope that time and distance would bring them both the clarity they needed.  

## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Stillness (Continued)  

Maya stared at her phone, Ethan’s message glaring back at her like a spotlight on her insecurities.  

**“I think we need to take a step back. For real this time.”**  

The words felt like a slap, each one cutting deeper than the last. She wanted to scream, to throw her phone across the room, to erase the ache spreading through her chest. Instead, she set the phone down gently, her hands trembling.  

For a moment, she just sat there, her thoughts a tangled mess of anger, sadness, and confusion. Why did it feel like everyone in her life kept walking away?  

---

As the hours passed, her emotions began to shift. The anger faded into something softer—something she didn’t want to name. She picked up her sketchbook, hoping to distract herself, but the blank page stared back at her, refusing to cooperate.  

With a sigh, she grabbed her phone and called Clara.  

“Hey,” Clara said, her voice warm but cautious. “What’s up?”  

Maya hesitated, her throat tightening. “Ethan wants to take a step back,” she said finally.  

There was a pause. “Oh,” Clara said softly. “How do you feel about that?”  

Maya laughed bitterly. “How do you think I feel? I hate it. I don’t understand why he keeps pulling away when all I’ve done is try to be there for him.”  

Clara was quiet for a moment. “Maya,” she said carefully, “have you thought about whether he might need space for himself? Maybe it’s not about you—it’s about what he’s going through.”  

Maya frowned, the words prickling at her defenses. “But I’ve been there for him,” she said. “I’ve tried so hard to make things work. Why isn’t that enough?”  

“Maybe it’s not about effort,” Clara said gently. “Maybe it’s about letting him figure things out without feeling like he has to answer to someone else.”  

Maya’s chest tightened, her mind racing. She wanted to argue, to defend herself, but deep down, a small voice whispered that Clara might be right.  

---

The next day, Maya found herself walking aimlessly through the park, her thoughts a storm of conflicting emotions. She hated feeling like this—so untethered, so out of control.  

She sat down on a bench near the lake, pulling her coat tighter around her. Her mind drifted to her childhood, to the way her parents had always given her whatever she wanted. New toys, fancy vacations, endless praise—it had all come so easily.  

But what hadn’t come easily was learning how to handle disappointment. Whenever something didn’t go her way, her parents had smoothed it over, making sure she never had to face the uncomfortable reality of not getting what she wanted.  

Now, as an adult, she was realizing just how unprepared she was for moments like this.  

---

Later that evening, Maya sat in her studio, staring at a half-finished painting. Her brush hovered over the canvas, her movements hesitant and uncertain.  

For so long, she’d poured her energy into seeking validation from others—her parents, her teachers, Ethan. She’d never stopped to think about what it would mean to validate herself.  

“What does it mean to just be me?” she thought, the question both terrifying and freeing.  

---

Maya picked up her phone and opened her messages. She stared at Ethan’s name for a long time, her finger hovering over the keyboard.  

Finally, she typed:  

**Maya:** I’m sorry if I’ve made you feel like you couldn’t take the space you needed. I’ve been scared of losing you, but I think I need to figure out who I am without relying on you to make me feel whole.  

She stared at the message, her chest tightening. Then, before she could second-guess herself, she hit send.  

---

The next morning, Maya woke to Ethan’s reply.  

**Ethan:** Thank you, Maya. That means a lot. I hope you find what you’re looking for.  

The message was simple, but it carried a weight that made her eyes sting with unshed tears.  

For the first time, she felt like she wasn’t just losing Ethan—she was letting go.  

And though it hurt, it also felt like the first step toward something new.
