# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles  

Ethan tapped his fingers nervously against the edge of his phone, rereading his last message to Maya.  

**Ethan:** Hey, how’s the new project going?  

It had been almost two hours since he’d sent it, and the silence on her end felt heavier than it should have. He reminded himself that Maya could just be busy, but the doubt lingered.  

It hadn’t always been this way.  

---

A week earlier, Maya had confronted him after one of their coffee meetups.  

“You’re not putting enough into this,” she said abruptly as they left the café.  

Ethan blinked, caught off guard. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, it feels like I’m the only one who’s trying sometimes,” Maya said, crossing her arms. “You don’t text me as much, and when we hang out, it’s like you’re just going through the motions.”  

Ethan frowned, guilt stirring in his chest. “Maya, that’s not true. I care about this friendship. I’m just trying to make sure we’re… balanced, you know? That we’re not slipping into old habits.”  

Maya sighed, looking away. “I just feel like you’re holding back. Like you’re afraid to really be here.”  

Ethan hesitated, the words hitting too close to home. “I’m not holding back,” he said carefully. “I’m just trying to be reasonable—for both of us.”  

Maya didn’t respond, her silence cutting deeper than any argument could.  

---

Since that conversation, Ethan had made an effort to reach out more, sending her messages, checking in, and even suggesting meetups. But something had shifted.  

Maya seemed distant, her replies short and infrequent. She canceled plans more often than not, always with a vague excuse about being busy.  

And now, as Ethan sat staring at his unanswered text, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d done something wrong—or if she was deliberately pulling away.  

---

A few days later, Ethan finally heard back from her.  

**Maya:** Sorry, been swamped with the exhibit stuff. What’s up?  

Her message was casual, almost dismissive, and it stung more than he wanted to admit.  

**Ethan:** Just wanted to check in. Let me know if you want to grab coffee soon.  

Her reply came an hour later: **Maya:** Maybe next week? I’ll let you know.  

Ethan sighed, setting his phone down. He couldn’t shake the feeling that their friendship was slipping into something uneven again. He was trying—wasn’t he? So why did it feel like she wasn’t?  

---

As the days passed, Ethan’s unease grew. He found himself second-guessing every interaction, every message he sent her.  

When she didn’t reply quickly, he wondered if she was ignoring him. When she did reply, her tone felt detached, almost obligatory.  

He tried to focus on other things—his writing, his classes, his friends—but the tension with Maya lingered like a shadow over everything.  

---

One evening, as Ethan sat in the library, Liam joined him, dropping into the seat across the table.  

“You look like you’re overthinking again,” Liam said, raising an eyebrow.  

Ethan sighed, running a hand through his hair. “It’s Maya. I feel like I’m trying to do everything right, but she’s pulling away, and I don’t know why.”  

Liam frowned thoughtfully. “Have you talked to her about it?”  

“I don’t want to start a fight,” Ethan admitted. “I just… I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if she’s actually ignoring me.”  

“Maybe she’s going through something,” Liam suggested. “Or maybe she doesn’t realize how it’s making you feel.”  

“Maybe,” Ethan said, though the doubt lingered.  

---

That night, Ethan decided to send her one more message.  

**Ethan:** Hey, hope everything’s okay. Just wanted to check in. No pressure, but let me know if you want to talk.  

Her reply came the next morning.  

**Maya:** Thanks, Ethan. I’m fine. Just busy.  

It was a perfectly reasonable response, but something about it felt off—like she was keeping him at arm’s length.  

For the first time, Ethan wondered if Maya was avoiding him intentionally—or if she simply didn’t value their friendship as much as he did.  

---

The uncertainty gnawed at him, leaving him torn between wanting to confront her and fearing the fallout of another confrontation.  

He cared about Maya deeply, but he couldn’t ignore the growing imbalance between them. Was he holding on too tightly? Or was she letting go too easily?  

And as he sat staring at his phone, waiting for a reply that might never come, Ethan couldn’t help but wonder if this new chapter in their friendship was destined to end before it had even truly begun.  

 

Days turned into weeks, and the gap between Ethan and Maya continued to grow. Despite his efforts to stay connected, Maya’s replies remained brief, her presence in his life feeling more like a flicker than a flame.  

Ethan found himself caught in a cycle of overthinking—replaying their conversations, analyzing her texts, and wondering if he was doing too much or not enough.  

One afternoon, as he walked across campus, he decided to visit the art building. Maybe seeing her in person would clear the air.  

---

When Ethan arrived, the studio was buzzing with activity. Students worked on their projects, their voices a low hum in the background. Maya was near the back, her focus locked on a large canvas filled with bold, chaotic strokes.  

“Hey,” Ethan said, his voice tentative as he approached.  

Maya looked up, her expression briefly lighting up before settling into something more neutral. “Oh, hey. What are you doing here?”  

Ethan hesitated, suddenly feeling out of place. “I just wanted to check in. I haven’t seen you much lately.”  

Maya sighed, setting her brush down. “Yeah, sorry about that. Things have been… hectic.”  

“It’s okay,” Ethan said quickly, though the weight in his chest didn’t ease. “I just wanted to make sure everything’s alright.”  

“I’m fine,” Maya said, her tone clipped. “Just busy.”  

The words felt like a door closing, and Ethan nodded slowly, stepping back. “Alright. I’ll let you get back to it.”  

Maya gave him a small smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Thanks for stopping by.”  

---

As Ethan walked back to his dorm, he replayed the interaction in his mind, trying to make sense of the distance between them. He’d expected the visit to bring clarity, but it only left him more confused.  

For the first time, he wondered if Maya truly wanted him in her life—or if she was keeping him around out of obligation.  

---

That evening, Ethan vented to Liam over a game of pool in the student lounge.  

“She says she’s fine, but it doesn’t feel fine,” Ethan said, lining up his shot. “I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if she’s actually pulling away.”  

Liam leaned against the table, watching him carefully. “Have you told her how you feel?”  

Ethan shook his head. “No. I don’t want to make things worse. What if I’m overreacting?”  

“What if you’re not?” Liam countered. “You’re putting in the effort, Ethan. If she’s not meeting you halfway, maybe it’s time to figure out why.”  

Ethan sighed, sinking the ball into the pocket. “Easier said than done.”  

---

Meanwhile, Maya sat alone in her studio, staring at her unfinished painting. Her conversation with Ethan earlier had left her unsettled, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on why.  

She cared about him deeply, but lately, she’d found herself withdrawing—not because she didn’t want him in her life, but because she didn’t know how to bridge the gap between them.  

Their friendship, as much as she valued it, felt fragile—like a delicate balance she wasn’t sure she could maintain.  

---

A few days later, Maya finally reached out.  

**Maya:** Hey, want to grab coffee? My treat.  

Ethan stared at the message for a long moment before replying.  

**Ethan:** Sure. When?  

**Maya:** Tomorrow afternoon?  

**Ethan:** Sounds good.  

The next day, as they sat across from each other in the café, the air between them felt heavier than it had in weeks.  

“I’m sorry if I’ve been distant,” Maya said suddenly, her gaze fixed on her cup.  

Ethan looked up, surprised. “It’s okay. I figured you’ve been busy.”  

Maya hesitated, then shook her head. “It’s not just that. I think… I’ve been scared.”  

“Scared of what?” Ethan asked gently.  

“Of messing this up,” Maya admitted. “I don’t want to lose you, Ethan. But sometimes, it feels like I don’t know how to be your friend without… wanting more.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, and he took a deep breath before replying. “Maya, I care about you. But I think we need to be honest with each other about what this friendship looks like. Otherwise, we’re just going to keep hurting each other.”  

Maya nodded slowly, her expression conflicted. “You’re right. I just… I don’t know how to stop feeling like this.”  

Ethan hesitated, then reached across the table, his hand brushing hers briefly. “It’s okay to feel that way. But maybe it’s something we both need to figure out on our own.”  

Maya looked at him, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “I don’t want to lose you,” she said again, her voice barely above a whisper.  

“You won’t,” Ethan said softly. “But we have to be honest with ourselves—and each other—if this is going to work.”  

---

When they parted ways that afternoon, Ethan felt a strange mix of relief and uncertainty. They’d said the things that needed to be said, but the road ahead still felt murky, filled with questions he didn’t yet have answers for.  

As he walked back to his dorm, he couldn’t help but wonder if they were truly moving forward—or if they were just delaying the inevitable.  

---

Ethan stared at his phone, his latest message to Maya sitting unread. The minutes stretched into an hour, then two, as the familiar knot of doubt tightened in his chest. He told himself she was probably busy, but the silence felt heavier than it should have.  

He tried to distract himself, flipping through a book he’d been meaning to finish, but the words blurred on the page. Eventually, he gave up, setting the book aside and reaching for his phone again. Still no response.  

This had become a pattern lately—him reaching out, trying to keep the conversation alive, while her replies came slower and shorter. He didn’t know when the shift had started, but it was impossible to ignore.  

The last time they’d met for coffee, Maya had seemed distant, her attention drifting as he spoke. He’d noticed her checking her phone more often, her responses clipped and vague.  

“Everything okay?” he’d asked cautiously.  

“Yeah, just tired,” she’d replied with a quick smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.  

Ethan had let it go at the time, not wanting to press her, but now the memory nagged at him. Was she pulling away, or was he reading too much into it?  

---

Liam’s voice broke through his thoughts later that evening as they walked back from class.  

“You’ve been quiet lately. What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, debating whether to bring it up. “It’s Maya,” he admitted finally. “I feel like she’s slipping away, and I don’t know what to do about it.”  

Liam frowned. “Slipping away how?”  

“She barely texts back, and when she does, it feels… off. Like she’s just going through the motions,” Ethan said, his frustration spilling out. “I’m trying to be there for her, but it’s like no matter what I do, it’s never enough.”  

“Have you talked to her about it?” Liam asked.  

Ethan shook his head. “I don’t want to start a fight. What if I’m overreacting?”  

Liam gave him a pointed look. “And what if you’re not? You’ve been twisting yourself into knots trying to figure this out. Maybe it’s time to stop guessing and just ask her.”  

Ethan sighed, unsure if he was ready for the answer.  

---

Later that night, as he lay in bed, Ethan drafted a message to Maya. He stared at the words for what felt like an eternity, his thumb hovering over the send button.  

**Ethan:** Hey, can we talk sometime? I feel like things have been different lately, and I just want to make sure we’re okay.  

His chest tightened as he finally hit send, the weight of the message settling over him.  

All he could do now was wait.  

---

Ethan checked his phone more times than he wanted to admit. Each time, the empty notification screen felt like a quiet rejection.  

It wasn’t until the next afternoon that Maya finally replied.  

**Maya:** Hey, sorry I’ve been so busy. We can talk if you want, but I’m not sure what you mean by “different.”  

Ethan read the message twice, trying to parse her words. Was she genuinely unaware, or was she deflecting? He couldn’t tell.  

Taking a deep breath, he typed out his reply.  

**Ethan:** I guess I’ve just felt some distance between us. I’m trying to keep things good between us, but it feels like something’s off.  

Maya’s response came quickly this time.  

**Maya:** I don’t know, Ethan. I’m fine. Maybe you’re overthinking things?  

Ethan frowned, her words stirring a mix of frustration and doubt. Was he overthinking? He’d spent so much time questioning himself lately that he couldn’t tell where his feelings ended and reality began.  

---

Later that evening, Maya sat in her studio, staring at her phone. Ethan’s message lingered in her mind, a nagging weight she couldn’t shake.  

She cared about him—she did—but lately, their friendship had felt like an obligation rather than a comfort. She hated admitting it, even to herself, but she wasn’t sure if she had the energy to give him what he seemed to need.  

Her life was changing. The art exhibit she’d been working on was consuming most of her time, and she’d started spending more time with a new group of friends—people who didn’t know the complicated history she shared with Ethan.  

It wasn’t that she wanted to push him away, but being around him sometimes felt heavy, like a reminder of everything she was trying to move past.  

---

For Ethan, the waiting was the hardest part. Maya’s short replies left him feeling more uncertain than ever, and the lack of clarity was starting to take its toll.  

He thought about the way things used to be—the easy laughter, the long conversations, the sense of mutual understanding. But that connection felt like a distant memory now, replaced by something fragile and strained.  

Liam’s words echoed in his mind: *“Maybe it’s time to stop guessing and just ask her.”*  

But he’d asked, hadn’t he? And her answers, vague as they were, hadn’t brought him any closer to understanding.  

Ethan found himself questioning not just their friendship, but himself. Was he too much? Too demanding? Or was he not enough?  

The uncertainty gnawed at him, leaving him stuck in a cycle of self-doubt.  

---

A few days later, Maya messaged him again.  

**Maya:** Hey, sorry if I’ve been distant. Things have just been crazy lately. Hope you’re doing okay.  

Ethan stared at the message, unsure how to respond. Her words felt polite but hollow, like they were meant to reassure him without addressing the deeper issues between them.  

He typed out a reply, deleted it, then typed another. Finally, he settled on something simple:  

**Ethan:** Thanks for checking in. I hope things settle down for you soon.  

The conversation ended there, the silence that followed more deafening than any argument.  

---

For the first time, Ethan started to wonder if this was how it would always be—an endless push and pull, where he was left chasing a connection that no longer felt mutual.  

And though he didn’t want to admit it, a small, painful part of him wondered if letting go was the only way to find peace.  

---

Ethan didn’t bring up the message again. He told himself it was because he didn’t want to pressure Maya, but the truth was more complicated. A part of him was afraid—afraid of pushing her too far and watching her pull away completely.  

He tried to focus on other things—his writing, his friends, the projects piling up as the semester neared its end. But no matter how busy he kept himself, thoughts of Maya lingered, creeping in during quiet moments.  

Was he expecting too much? Or was she giving too little? The questions circled endlessly in his mind, leaving him no closer to an answer.  

---

Maya, meanwhile, found herself grappling with emotions she didn’t fully understand.  

She cared about Ethan—she always would—but their friendship had started to feel like a weight she couldn’t carry. Every time she saw his name on her phone screen, a knot of guilt formed in her chest.  

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to reply—it was that she didn’t know how. She didn’t know how to explain the growing distance between them without hurting him.  

But the truth was undeniable: she was moving on. Her life was changing, and the version of Ethan she’d once leaned on no longer fit into the person she was trying to become.  

---

A week later, they met again, this time at the park. It was Maya’s suggestion—a rare gesture that gave Ethan a glimmer of hope.  

They sat on the same bench where they’d shared so many conversations in the past, the early spring breeze carrying the scent of blooming flowers.  

“You’ve been quiet,” Ethan said after a while, breaking the silence.  

“Yeah,” Maya admitted, her gaze fixed on the ground. “I guess I’ve had a lot on my mind.”  

Ethan hesitated, then asked the question he’d been avoiding. “Are we okay, Maya?”  

She looked up at him, her expression unreadable. “I don’t know,” she said softly. “I feel like things have been… different.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened. “Different how?”  

Maya sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I guess I’ve been trying to figure out where I fit—in my life, in everything. And sometimes, it feels like I don’t have the energy to give you what you need.”  

Her words hung in the air, heavy and raw.  

“I’m not asking for much,” Ethan said quietly. “I just want to know where we stand.”  

Maya hesitated, then said, “I care about you, Ethan. I always will. But maybe we’ve been holding on to something that doesn’t work the way it used to.”  

---

Ethan nodded slowly, the weight of her words settling over him like a lead blanket. “So what happens now?”  

“I don’t know,” Maya admitted. “I think we need to figure out what this looks like—if it can work at all.”  

Ethan forced a small smile, though his heart ached. “I guess we’ll see.”  

They sat in silence after that, the distance between them feeling larger than the bench they shared.  

---

That evening, Ethan lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. He couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t enough—for Maya, for their friendship, for anything.  

The thought twisted in his chest, leaving him torn between anger and sadness. He wanted to believe he’d done his best, but the doubt lingered.  

Was he the problem? Or was this just the way things were meant to end?  

---

Maya, too, felt the weight of their conversation as she sat in her studio later that night. She stared at her half-finished painting, the colors swirling together in chaotic strokes that mirrored her emotions.  

She hated feeling like this—like she was the one walking away, the one giving up. But deep down, she knew that staying in this limbo would only hurt them both.  

For the first time, she allowed herself to imagine a future without Ethan in it. The thought stung, but it also brought a strange sense of relief.  

Maybe it was time to let go.  

 

A week after their conversation in the park, Ethan and Maya met for what felt like the last time—though neither of them dared to say it out loud. Maya had asked to meet at the coffee shop, her tone in the message neutral but unreadable.  

When Ethan arrived, she was already sitting at their usual table, her hands wrapped around a steaming cup of tea. She looked up as he approached, offering a small, tentative smile.  

“Hey,” she said softly.  

“Hey,” Ethan replied, sliding into the seat across from her.  

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The weight of all the unspoken words hung between them like a fog.  

---

Maya broke the silence first, her gaze fixed on her cup. “I wanted to say thank you,” she said quietly.  

Ethan frowned, confused. “For what?”  

“For everything,” she said, looking up at him. “For always being there for me, even when I didn’t deserve it. You’ve been a better friend to me than I’ve been to you, and I just… I wanted you to know how much that means to me.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened, her words cutting through him in ways he hadn’t expected. “Maya, you’ve been a good friend too,” he said, though the words felt hollow.  

She shook her head. “I haven’t. Not really. I’ve been selfish, Ethan. I’ve taken you for granted, and I think… I think part of me was scared to admit that.”  

Ethan didn’t know what to say. A part of him wanted to argue, to reassure her that she wasn’t as bad as she thought. But another part of him—one he’d been trying to ignore—knew she was right.  

---

“I think we’ve been holding on to something that doesn’t work anymore,” Maya said finally, her voice trembling. “And maybe it’s time we let it go.”  

Ethan swallowed hard, the ache in his chest threatening to spill over. “Yeah,” he said softly. “Maybe you’re right.”  

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she gave him a small, sad smile. “You’re going to be okay, you know. You’re going to do amazing things.”  

“You too,” Ethan said, his voice thick with emotion. “I mean it, Maya. You’ve got so much ahead of you.”  

---

They sat in silence for a few more minutes, the reality of their parting sinking in. When they finally stood to leave, Maya reached out and hugged him tightly, her arms lingering around him for just a moment too long.  

“Take care of yourself, Ethan,” she said as they pulled apart.  

“You too,” he replied, his voice barely above a whisper.  

And with that, she walked away, her figure disappearing into the crowd outside the café.  

---

Ethan sat back down at the table, staring at the empty seat across from him. The bittersweet finality of their conversation hung heavy in the air, leaving him torn between relief and sadness.  

He didn’t know if he’d done the right thing, or if there even was a “right” thing to do. All he knew was that something had ended, and he was left to pick up the pieces.  

---

Maya, meanwhile, walked through the bustling streets, her mind a storm of emotions. She told herself she’d done what was best for both of them, but the ache in her chest refused to go away.  

As she turned the corner toward her studio, she glanced up at the sky, the fading sunlight casting the buildings in shades of gold and gray.  

“Maybe this is what moving on feels like,” she thought.  

But even as the thought crossed her mind, she couldn’t help but wonder if she’d lost something she would never truly find again.  

---

That night, Ethan opened his journal and wrote:  

*“Letting go feels like breaking into pieces, but maybe it’s the only way to grow. I don’t know if I did the right thing, or if I could have done more. But for now, all I can do is keep moving forward and hope the pieces come back together someday.”*  

And as he closed the journal, the room quiet around him, Ethan allowed himself to hope that, in time, the ache would fade.  

Because sometimes, the hardest choices are the ones that lead to the most growth—even if they hurt.  

## Chapter 10: Unspoken Struggles (Concluded)

Ethan stayed at the café for a while after Maya left, watching the world move on around him. People came and went, their conversations and laughter filling the space, but it all felt distant—like he was watching it from behind a glass wall.  

He couldn’t shake the image of her walking away, her words replaying in his mind. *“I think we’ve been holding on to something that doesn’t work anymore.”*  

It was the truth, but that didn’t make it any easier to accept.  

---

That night, as Ethan sat at his desk, he opened his laptop and stared at the blank document in front of him. He’d been meaning to start a new poem, something to channel the tangled emotions swirling inside him, but the words refused to come.  

Instead, he opened his journal and wrote:  

*“It’s hard to let go of someone who’s been such a big part of your life. Hard to admit that things have changed, that people grow in different directions. But maybe that’s what love is—learning to let go when it’s time. Not because you don’t care, but because you do.”*  

He closed the journal, the weight in his chest lifting just slightly.  

---

Maya, meanwhile, sat in her studio, staring at the painting she’d been working on for weeks. It was almost finished, the bold, chaotic strokes capturing the whirlwind of emotions she hadn’t been able to put into words.  

She picked up her brush and added the final touches, a streak of soft gold blending into the darker tones. As she stepped back, she felt a quiet sense of completion—not just with the painting, but with the chapter of her life she was leaving behind.  

She thought about Ethan and the way he’d looked at her in the café, his eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and understanding. She wondered if he was okay, if he felt the same hollow ache she did.  

But deep down, she knew they’d made the right choice.  

---

The next morning, Ethan woke to a clear sky and the soft sound of birds outside his window. For the first time in weeks, he felt a small flicker of peace.  

Maya hadn’t left his life entirely—they’d still talk, still check in with each other from time to time. But the weight of trying to hold on to something that no longer fit was gone, replaced by a quiet acceptance.  

As he got ready for the day, he glanced at his journal sitting on the desk, the words he’d written the night before still fresh in his mind.  

*“Sometimes, moving on doesn’t mean forgetting. It means remembering with grace and letting yourself grow from the memories.”*  

---

Across campus, Maya walked into her studio with a new sense of purpose. She had projects to finish, ideas to explore, and a life to build for herself. And though a part of her would always carry Ethan with her, she knew it was time to focus on her own path.  

She picked up her brush, the sunlight streaming through the window illuminating her canvas. As the colors blended together, she felt a quiet hope stirring in her chest—a hope that, in time, they would both find their way.  

---

Though their journeys had diverged, Ethan and Maya carried the lessons they’d learned from each other, shaping the people they were becoming.  

And while they might not know what the future held, they both understood this: sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone you care about is to let them go.
