# Games Similar to Conway's Game of Life and Wumpus World

## 1. Langton's Ant
**Description**: Langton's Ant is a cellular automaton where an ant moves on a grid according to simple rules, creating complex patterns.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed version of Langton's Ant. The background should be black, with grid cells dynamically changing between two colors (e.g., white and neon blue) as the ant moves. Add simple controls for starting, pausing, resetting, and adjusting speed. The ant's movement and grid changes should be visually smooth and mesmerizing.

## 2. Wireworld
**Description**: Wireworld is a cellular automaton used to simulate logic circuits. Each cell transitions between four states based on its neighbors.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Wireworld simulation. Use a black background with cells displayed in bright neon colors (e.g., yellow for conductors, red for electrons). Include a grid editor where users can place and modify elements, a run/pause button, and a reset option. The grid should be scalable, and transitions between states should be smooth.

## 3. Game of Nim
**Description**: Nim is a mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing objects from heaps. The goal is to avoid being the one to take the last object.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Game of Nim. Use a black background with glowing, colorful heaps of objects (e.g., neon blue, green, and purple). Include a two-player mode and an AI opponent. Players should click to select and remove objects. Add subtle animations and sound effects for interactions.

## 4. Maze Generation and Solver
**Description**: A randomly generated maze where the user can control a character to find the exit.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed maze generator and solver. Use a black background with glowing grid lines and a bright neon character (e.g., green). The maze should be generated procedurally and have an option for manual play or automatic solving. Include controls for restarting, resizing, and toggling between modes.

## 5. Boids (Flocking Simulation)
**Description**: A simulation of bird flocking behavior using simple rules for alignment, separation, and cohesion.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Boids simulation. Use a black background with small glowing particles (e.g., neon blue, green, and purple) representing the boids. Boids should move smoothly, demonstrating flocking behavior. Include sliders to adjust parameters like speed, alignment, cohesion, and separation. Add a start/stop button and a reset option.

## 6. 2048
**Description**: A sliding tile puzzle game where numbers combine to reach 2048.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed 2048 game. Use a black background with tiles displayed in glowing, gradient neon colors (e.g., blue, green, pink). Include smooth animations for sliding and merging tiles, a score tracker, and a restart button. The game should have a clean, minimalist design.

## 7. Firefly Synchronization
**Description**: A simulation where fireflies flash and eventually synchronize their flashes over time.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Firefly Synchronization simulation. Use a black background with small, glowing dots (representing fireflies) that pulse at random intervals initially and gradually synchronize. Include controls for adjusting the number of fireflies and their initial flash randomness. Add subtle sound effects for flashing events.

## 8. Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualizer
**Description**: A visual demonstration of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualizer. Use a black background with glowing edges and nodes (e.g., blue for edges, green for the path). Allow users to draw the graph, set weights, and select start and end nodes. Animate the algorithm step-by-step with controls for pausing and resetting.

## 9. The Forest Fire Simulation
**Description**: A cellular automaton that simulates the spread of a fire in a forest based on probabilistic rules.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Forest Fire Simulation. Use a black background with glowing green cells (trees), red cells (fire), and dark gray (burned areas). Include controls to adjust the grid size, fire spread probability, and tree growth rate. Add a start/pause button and smooth transitions between states.

## 10. Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament
**Description**: A simulation of multiple strategies competing in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.

**Prompt**:  
Create a single HTML file for a dark-themed Prisoner's Dilemma tournament. Use a black background with glowing text and icons representing players. Players should compete using predefined strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Always Cooperate, Always Defect). Include an interactive chart to visualize scores and outcomes over multiple rounds.
