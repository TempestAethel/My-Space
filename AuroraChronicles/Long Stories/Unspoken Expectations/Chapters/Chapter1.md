# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths  

Ethan didn’t think much about the day when it began. It was one of those overcast mornings where the sun seemed too tired to push through the thick gray clouds. He adjusted the strap of his backpack, groaning inwardly at the weight of his textbooks, and shuffled into the bustling campus coffee shop.  

The café was alive with the usual noise: the hiss of the espresso machine, the murmur of students trading notes, and the occasional burst of laughter from a nearby table. Ethan didn’t belong to the loud crowd. He preferred the solitude of his laptop and the quiet corner seat that overlooked the courtyard. But today, someone else had taken it.  

She sat there, her sketchbook open, pencil moving furiously across the page. Loose strands of dark hair framed her face, and her brows furrowed in concentration. Ethan hesitated, unsure whether to interrupt. The corner seat wasn’t his by right, but he had claimed it often enough to feel a faint sense of ownership.  

“Looking for something?” her voice startled him. She glanced up, her eyes meeting his.  

“Uh, no. I mean, yes,” Ethan stammered, caught off guard. “I usually sit there.”  

“Oh,” she said, tilting her head. Her expression softened into an amused smile. “Territorial, are we? It’s a good spot, though. Can’t blame you for wanting it.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure whether to laugh or walk away. Instead, he gestured to the seat across from her. “Mind if I join you, then?”  

She paused, considering for a moment, before nodding. “Sure. But I warn you, I’m not great company when I’m working.”  

Ethan sat down, setting his bag on the floor and his laptop on the table. He tried not to stare as she resumed sketching, her pencil darting across the paper with an intensity that fascinated him. After a few moments of silence, curiosity got the better of him.  

“What are you working on?” he asked.  

She stopped, her hand hovering over the sketchbook. “Just… something for class,” she said vaguely, turning the page slightly so he couldn’t see. “You’re not an art student, are you?”  

Ethan shook his head. “Engineering.”  

“Figures,” she said with a small laugh. “You’ve got that ‘practical and logical’ look about you.”  

“And you’re the ‘creative and mysterious’ type?” he countered, surprising himself with his boldness.  

Her laughter was warm, disarming. “Maya,” she said, extending her hand.  

“Ethan,” he replied, shaking it.  

For the next hour, they shared the table in companionable silence. Ethan typed away at his project, while Maya sketched, occasionally muttering to herself about proportions and shadows. It was strange, Ethan thought, how comfortable it felt.  

When she finally packed up her things, she paused, looking at him thoughtfully. “You’re not so bad, Ethan. Maybe I’ll see you around.”  

Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving behind the faint scent of lavender and graphite. Ethan stared at the empty seat, a strange warmth spreading through his chest.  

He didn’t know it yet, but this small moment would mark the beginning of something that would change both their lives forever.  

---  

Ethan found himself returning to the coffee shop every day that week, half-hoping to see Maya again. It wasn’t like him to fixate on someone he barely knew, but there was something magnetic about her—an energy that pulled him in despite his better judgment.  

He’d never been great at starting conversations, let alone maintaining them. His world had always been numbers and formulas, carefully organized and predictable. Maya, on the other hand, seemed like chaos personified: vibrant, unpredictable, and endlessly intriguing.  

On Thursday, his wish was granted.  

She was there, in the same corner seat, with her sketchbook balanced precariously on her knees. This time, though, she looked less focused. Her pencil tapped against the edge of the table, and her eyes darted around the room, as if searching for something—or someone.  

Ethan hesitated in the doorway. His instinct was to turn around and leave before she noticed him, but his feet betrayed him, carrying him toward her table.  

“You’re back,” she said before he could even open his mouth. Her smile was warm but teasing. “Should I be flattered or concerned?”  

“Neither,” Ethan replied, surprising himself with how steady his voice sounded. “It’s just a good spot for studying.”  

“Hmm,” she hummed, narrowing her eyes playfully. “Sure it is. Sit, then. I could use a distraction.”  

Ethan slid into the chair across from her, his backpack hitting the floor with a dull thud. “Not working today?” he asked, nodding toward her sketchbook.  

She sighed, flipping the cover closed. “No inspiration. Everything I try feels… wrong. You ever get like that? Like no matter what you do, it’s just not good enough?”  

He hesitated, the weight of her words settling over him. “Yeah,” he admitted. “All the time.”  

Maya’s eyebrows lifted slightly, as if she hadn’t expected him to understand. “What do you do about it?”  

“Keep going,” he said after a moment. “Even when it feels pointless. Eventually, something clicks.”  

Her lips curved into a small smile. “Practical and logical strikes again.”  

They fell into an easy rhythm after that. Ethan pulled out his laptop, and Maya resumed her sketching. Occasionally, she’d glance up at him, and he’d pretend not to notice, focusing intently on his screen.  

“You know,” she said suddenly, breaking the silence, “you’re not as boring as I thought you’d be.”  

Ethan blinked, unsure whether to feel complimented or insulted. “Thanks… I think?”  

She laughed, a sound that felt like sunlight breaking through clouds. “It’s a good thing. Trust me.”  

For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he wasn’t just another face in the crowd. There was something about the way Maya looked at him—like he was worth noticing—that made him feel lighter, freer.  

As the afternoon stretched into evening, they packed up their things and walked out together. The campus was quiet now, bathed in the soft glow of streetlights.  

“So,” Maya said, stuffing her sketchbook into her bag. “Same time tomorrow?”  

Ethan smiled, a rare, genuine smile that caught even him off guard. “Yeah. Same time.”  

And just like that, the coffee shop became their spot.  

---  

Over the next two weeks, the coffee shop became an unspoken part of their routine. Ethan didn’t know how it happened—there was no explicit agreement, no promises exchanged—but every afternoon, like clockwork, Maya would be there, and he would follow.  

They quickly fell into a rhythm: Maya sketching, Ethan typing, the occasional exchange of banter filling the quiet spaces between them. It wasn’t anything extraordinary, and yet, it was. For someone like Ethan, whose days were usually marked by structured routines and predictable outcomes, this new connection felt like stepping into uncharted territory.  

“So,” Maya said one afternoon, tapping her pencil against her cheek as she studied him. “What’s the deal with you, Ethan?”  

He glanced up from his laptop, confused. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, you’re like this mysterious puzzle,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “Quiet, serious, always thinking. What’s going on in that head of yours?”  

Ethan chuckled, a little nervously. “Not much, honestly. Just trying to keep up with deadlines.”  

“Liar,” she said with a grin, her eyes narrowing playfully. “You’ve got that faraway look sometimes. Like you’re carrying the weight of the world. Spill.”  

He hesitated, unsure how to respond. No one had ever asked him something like that before. Not really.  

“I guess I’m just… used to keeping things to myself,” he admitted finally, his voice quieter than usual.  

Maya’s expression softened, and for a moment, she was silent. “You don’t have to, you know,” she said, her voice equally soft. “Keep everything to yourself, I mean. You can talk to me. If you want.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure why her words affected him the way they did. Maybe it was the sincerity in her tone, or the way her gaze held his, steady and unflinching. Either way, something shifted in him at that moment, like a door creaking open just a crack.  

“Thanks,” he said simply, not trusting himself to say more.  

The conversation moved on after that, as it always did. Maya had a way of keeping things light when they needed to be, of pulling Ethan out of his own head and into the present moment.  

But later that night, as Ethan lay in bed staring at the ceiling, her words echoed in his mind.  

You can talk to me.  

It wasn’t something he’d heard often—not from his parents, who were loving but distant, nor from his friends, who preferred surface-level conversations over anything too deep. The idea that someone actually wanted to understand him was… new. And terrifying.  

The next day, as they sat across from each other in the coffee shop, Ethan found himself studying Maya more closely. She was different from anyone he’d ever met—passionate, expressive, unafraid to speak her mind. She talked about her art with a kind of fervor that Ethan couldn’t help but admire, even if he didn’t fully understand it.  

“You know,” he said suddenly, surprising himself, “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like you.”  

Maya looked up, startled. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean… you’re just so…” He struggled to find the right word. “Alive. Like, you see the world in this way that most people don’t. It’s… inspiring.”  

For the first time since he’d met her, Maya seemed genuinely at a loss for words. A faint blush crept into her cheeks, and she ducked her head, hiding her smile behind her hand.  

“Careful, Ethan,” she said after a moment, her voice teasing but soft. “Say things like that, and you might make me like you.”  

The words were light, playful, but they left a strange warmth in the air between them—something unspoken, fragile, and new.  

Ethan didn’t know what it was, exactly, but he knew one thing for certain: he didn’t want to lose it.  

---  

For the first time in years, Ethan found himself looking forward to something outside of his usual routines. It wasn’t just the coffee shop or the quiet hours spent typing away on his laptop—it was Maya. She had a way of lighting up even the dullest moments, of turning everyday conversations into something vivid and alive.  

But beneath the surface of their easy camaraderie, something else was beginning to grow. Ethan could feel it in the way his heart skipped a beat when Maya laughed, or how his chest tightened when their eyes met.  

He wasn’t sure what it was, exactly. All he knew was that it terrified him.  

One evening, as they sat in their usual corner, Maya broke the comfortable silence with a question that caught Ethan off guard.  

“Why engineering?” she asked, resting her chin in her hand as she studied him.  

Ethan blinked, glancing up from his screen. “What do you mean?”  

“I mean, why’d you choose it? Was it something you always wanted, or just… practical?”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. “A little of both, I guess. I’ve always been good at math and problem-solving. It just made sense.”  

Maya tilted her head, her expression thoughtful. “Do you like it, though? Like, really like it?”  

Ethan frowned, caught off guard by the question. No one had ever asked him that before—not his parents, not his professors, not even himself.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted after a moment. “I guess I’ve never thought about it that way.”  

Maya smiled faintly, her eyes softening. “That’s the thing about you, Ethan. You’re so good at doing what’s expected of you, but I wonder… what would you do if no one expected anything?”  

The question lingered in the air between them, heavy and unspoken. Ethan didn’t have an answer, but the weight of it settled in his chest, making it hard to breathe.  

“What about you?” he asked, deflecting the spotlight. “Why art?”  

Maya’s face lit up, and for a moment, Ethan forgot about his own uncertainties.  

“I’ve always loved it,” she said, her voice brimming with passion. “The way you can take something as simple as a pencil and paper and turn it into… anything. A feeling, a story, a memory. It’s like magic.”  

Ethan watched her as she spoke, the way her hands moved animatedly, her eyes sparkling with excitement. There was a fire in her that he couldn’t help but admire—a fire he sometimes wished he had for himself.  

“You’re lucky,” he said quietly.  

Maya stopped, tilting her head. “Why do you say that?”  

“Because you know what you love,” he said. “And you’re not afraid to go after it.”  

Her expression softened, and for a moment, she just looked at him, her gaze steady and unflinching. “You know, Ethan,” she said, her voice gentle, “just because you haven’t figured it out yet doesn’t mean you won’t. Everyone’s path is different.”  

The sincerity in her words caught him off guard. For a fleeting moment, he wondered how someone like her—a whirlwind of creativity and passion—could see anything worth admiring in someone like him.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

They stayed until the café began to close, the once-busy room now empty and quiet. As they gathered their things and stepped out into the cool night air, Ethan felt a strange sense of calm settle over him.  

For the first time in a long while, he didn’t feel so alone.  

As they walked across the campus, their footsteps echoing in the quiet, Maya glanced over at him with a small smile. “Same time tomorrow?”  

Ethan nodded, his lips curving into a faint smile of his own. “Same time.”  

And as they parted ways, Ethan couldn’t help but feel that this—whatever it was—was only the beginning.  

---  

Ethan didn’t think much about how quickly Maya had become a part of his life until Ryan noticed.  

“Okay, spill it,” Ryan said one afternoon, slapping his tray down on the table in the campus dining hall.  

Ethan frowned, barely looking up from his laptop. “Spill what?”  

“You’ve been acting weird,” Ryan said, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. “Like… less stressed, more distracted. You even skipped our study session last night, which, by the way, is very unlike you. What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. Ryan wasn’t wrong. He *had* been distracted lately—by Maya, by her laughter, by the way her presence seemed to brighten even the dullest moments. But how could he explain that to Ryan without sounding ridiculous?  

“I’ve been busy,” Ethan said finally, his voice nonchalant.  

Ryan raised an eyebrow. “Busy with what? And don’t tell me it’s school because I know for a fact that you’re weeks ahead on all your assignments.”  

Ethan sighed, shutting his laptop with a soft click. “There’s this girl,” he admitted, his tone hesitant.  

Ryan’s eyes lit up, and a grin spread across his face. “A *girl*? Ethan, you dog! Who is she? How long has this been going on? Why am I just hearing about this now?”  

“It’s not like that,” Ethan said quickly, feeling his cheeks heat. “We’re just… friends.”  

“Uh-huh,” Ryan said, leaning back in his chair with a knowing smirk. “Sure you are.”  

Ethan didn’t bother arguing. Ryan wasn’t entirely wrong. There was something between him and Maya—something unspoken, fragile, and new. But he wasn’t sure if it was real, or if it was just his imagination running wild.  

Later that day, as he sat across from Maya in the coffee shop, Ryan’s words echoed in his mind.  

“So,” Maya said, snapping him out of his thoughts. “What’s on your mind today?”  

“Nothing,” Ethan said quickly, though the blush creeping up his neck betrayed him.  

Maya raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. “You’re a terrible liar, you know that?”  

Ethan chuckled softly, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just Ryan being… Ryan.”  

“Ah,” Maya said with a grin. “What did he say this time?”  

“He thinks we’re…” Ethan hesitated, unsure how to phrase it. “That we’re… more than friends.”  

Maya’s expression shifted, her teasing smile softening into something unreadable. For a moment, she didn’t say anything, and Ethan’s heart pounded in the silence.  

“And what do you think?” she asked finally, her voice quiet.  

Ethan opened his mouth to respond, but the words caught in his throat. What *did* he think? He wasn’t sure. All he knew was that being around Maya made him feel alive in a way he hadn’t felt in years.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya’s lips curved into a faint smile, and she leaned back in her chair, her eyes thoughtful. “Well, I guess we’ll figure it out. No rush, right?”  

“Right,” Ethan said, though his chest tightened at the thought.  

They didn’t talk about it again that day, but the conversation lingered in Ethan’s mind long after they’d parted ways.  

That night, as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, he replayed her words over and over.  

No rush.  

But even as he tried to reassure himself, a quiet voice in the back of his mind whispered something else entirely:  

What if this was the beginning of something he couldn’t afford to lose?  

---  

Ethan found himself thinking about Maya more than he cared to admit. It wasn’t just the time they spent together, though those moments felt like they carried their own gravity. It was the way her voice lingered in his thoughts, her laughter playing like a distant melody long after they’d parted ways.

That weekend, Maya invited him to her art studio—a small, cluttered space tucked away in an older part of campus. Ethan hesitated at first, feeling out of place among the bright canvases and jars of paint, but Maya’s enthusiasm was infectious.  

“Come on, don’t just stand there,” she said, grabbing his hand and pulling him toward a half-finished painting propped against the wall. “Tell me what you think.”  

The painting was abstract, full of swirling colors and textures that seemed to shift and change the longer he looked at it. Ethan had no idea how to interpret it, but he didn’t want to disappoint her.  

“It’s… beautiful,” he said finally, and he meant it.  

Maya beamed, her eyes lighting up. “Thanks. It’s not finished yet, but it’s getting there.”  

Ethan watched as she picked up a brush and started adding small strokes of blue to the canvas. Her movements were precise yet fluid, as if she were following some invisible rhythm only she could hear.  

“You really love this, don’t you?” he said quietly.  

Maya paused, glancing at him over her shoulder. “I do. It’s the only thing that makes sense to me sometimes.”  

Ethan nodded, though he couldn’t fully relate. His own path had always been dictated by practicality and logic, not passion. Watching Maya, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy.  

“What about you?” she asked, turning back to him. “What’s your thing?”  

“My thing?”  

“Yeah,” she said, smiling. “What makes you feel alive?”  

Ethan hesitated, caught off guard by the question. He wanted to say something meaningful, something that would match the fire in her eyes, but all he could manage was a shrug.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve never really thought about it.”  

Maya studied him for a moment, her expression thoughtful. “Well,” she said finally, setting down her brush, “maybe it’s time you did.”  

Her words stayed with him long after he left the studio. That night, as he lay in bed, Ethan found himself staring at the ceiling, replaying the conversation in his mind.  

What makes you feel alive?  

He didn’t have an answer yet, but for the first time, he realized he wanted to find one.  

---

The following week, their usual coffee shop routine continued, but something felt different. Maya seemed more animated, her sketches growing bolder and more intricate with each passing day. Ethan, meanwhile, found himself opening up in ways he never had before.  

One afternoon, as they sat in their usual corner, Ethan surprised himself by sharing a memory from his childhood—a story about building a treehouse with his dad and the frustration of trying to get every measurement just right.  

Maya laughed, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “That’s so you,” she said, shaking her head. “Even as a kid, you were all about precision.”  

Ethan grinned, feeling a warmth spread through him at her laughter. “What about you? Were you always into art?”  

“Pretty much,” she said, resting her chin in her hand. “My mom used to say I’d cover every surface in the house with doodles if she let me. I guess I just never stopped.”  

They fell into an easy rhythm after that, trading stories and teasing each other about their quirks. For the first time in a long while, Ethan felt like he didn’t have to overthink every word or action. With Maya, everything just… flowed.  

As the evening wore on, Ethan found himself glancing at her more often, noticing the way the light caught the strands of her hair, the way her lips curved when she smiled.  

He didn’t say anything, but deep down, he knew: he was falling for her.  

---  

Ethan didn’t know how long he could keep pretending that his feelings for Maya were just friendly. Every time they met at the coffee shop or spent time together at her studio, the line between friendship and something more grew thinner.  

It wasn’t just the way she smiled at him or how her laughter lingered in the air—it was the way she made him feel seen, like he wasn’t just another face in the crowd.  

One evening, as they walked across campus after their usual coffee shop session, Maya turned to him, her expression thoughtful.  

“You ever think about what you want to do after all this?” she asked, gesturing vaguely at the campus around them.  

“After graduation, you mean?”  

“Yeah.”  

Ethan stuffed his hands into his pockets, his gaze fixed on the sidewalk. “I guess I’ll get a job in engineering. Find something stable.”  

Maya wrinkled her nose. “Stable sounds boring.”  

He chuckled softly. “What about you?”  

“Me?” Maya’s eyes lit up, and she turned to walk backward, facing him. “I’m going to travel. Visit all the places I’ve only seen in books and movies. Paris, Tokyo, maybe even some tiny village in Italy where nobody knows my name. I want to paint everything—capture the world on my canvas.”  

Ethan smiled, though a part of him felt an odd ache at the thought of her leaving. “That sounds… incredible.”  

“It will be,” she said with certainty. Then, her gaze softened, and she added, “You should come with me.”  

Ethan stopped in his tracks, caught off guard. “What?”  

“Not forever,” she said quickly, as if reading his mind. “Just for a little while. You could take a break before starting your big, stable engineering job. See the world. Live a little.”  

Her words lingered in the air between them, filled with possibility. Ethan wanted to say yes, but something held him back—a quiet voice in the back of his mind reminding him of responsibilities, expectations, and the carefully planned path he’d always followed.  

“I don’t know,” he said finally, his voice quiet.  

Maya smiled faintly, a mix of understanding and disappointment in her eyes. “Think about it,” she said, turning to walk ahead of him again. “You’ve got time.”  

They walked in silence after that, the weight of the conversation settling over them. By the time they reached the edge of campus, where their paths usually diverged, Maya turned to him with her usual bright smile, as if nothing had changed.  

“Same time tomorrow?” she asked.  

Ethan nodded. “Same time.”  

But as he watched her walk away, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted—something he didn’t fully understand yet.  

---

That night, Ethan couldn’t sleep. He stared at the ceiling, Maya’s words echoing in his mind.  

“You should come with me.”  

It wasn’t just the idea of traveling that unsettled him—it was the realization that, for the first time, he wanted something more than stability, more than the carefully constructed life he’d always envisioned.  

He wanted her.  

But how could he tell her that without risking everything they’d built? What if she didn’t feel the same way? What if his feelings ruined the one thing in his life that felt steady and real?  

Ethan sighed, running a hand through his hair. He’d always been good at solving problems, but this was one equation he couldn’t figure out.  

The only thing he knew for certain was that Maya had changed something in him—opened a door he hadn’t even realized was there.  

And now, he wasn’t sure if he could close it again.  

---  

The next day, Ethan arrived at the coffee shop earlier than usual. The familiar buzz of conversation filled the air, but for once, it didn’t comfort him. He found himself restless, his mind replaying the previous night’s conversation with Maya.  

“You should come with me.”  

He wanted to believe she’d meant it casually, just another whimsical suggestion from someone who saw the world as an open canvas. But a part of him wondered if there had been more to her words—if she’d been asking him for something he wasn’t ready to give.  

Maya arrived a few minutes later, her sketchbook tucked under one arm and a mischievous smile playing on her lips. “You’re early,” she said, sliding into the seat across from him.  

“Yeah,” Ethan said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I guess I had some extra time.”  

She raised an eyebrow but didn’t press the issue. Instead, she pulled out her sketchbook and flipped to a blank page. “I’ve been thinking,” she said, tapping her pencil against the table. “You should let me draw you.”  

Ethan blinked. “Me?”  

“Yeah, you,” she said, grinning. “You’ve got one of those faces. Kind of serious, but with a lot going on underneath. It’s interesting.”  

Ethan chuckled nervously. “I don’t know about that.”  

“Oh, come on,” she said, leaning forward. “You sit still for hours anyway. It’ll be easy.”  

He hesitated, unsure if he could handle being the subject of her attention for that long. But the way she was looking at him—bright-eyed and expectant—made it impossible to say no.  

“Fine,” he said, sighing. “But if it turns out terrible, I’m blaming you.”  

Maya laughed, already pulling a pencil from her bag. “Deal.”  

As she began to sketch, Ethan tried to focus on his laptop, but it was impossible to ignore the way her eyes flicked up to meet his every few seconds, studying him with an intensity that made his heart race.  

“You don’t have to look so nervous,” she said after a while, her voice light. “I’m not judging you.”  

“I’m not nervous,” Ethan said quickly, though the warmth creeping up his neck betrayed him.  

Maya smirked, clearly unconvinced. “Whatever you say.”  

The minutes stretched on, and slowly, Ethan began to relax. There was something calming about the quiet scratch of her pencil against the paper, the way her brow furrowed in concentration.  

“Done,” she said finally, holding up the sketch with a triumphant smile.  

Ethan leaned forward, his curiosity outweighing his apprehension. The drawing was simple, yet striking—a reflection of himself through her eyes. Somehow, she’d managed to capture more than just his features. There was a softness to it, a depth that made him feel both vulnerable and seen.  

“Wow,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “That’s… amazing.”  

Maya’s smile softened. “Thanks. You’re a pretty good subject, you know.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure what to say to that, so he just nodded, his gaze lingering on the sketch.  

As they packed up their things and prepared to leave, Maya slipped the drawing into her bag without a word. Ethan thought about asking her what she planned to do with it, but something stopped him.  

Instead, they walked out together, the silence between them comfortable but charged with something unspoken.  

---

That night, Ethan found himself staring at his reflection in the mirror, thinking about the version of himself Maya had drawn.  

He didn’t know how she’d done it, but somehow, she’d captured more than just his likeness. She’d captured a piece of him he hadn’t even realized was there—a piece that only seemed to come alive when he was with her.  

And for the first time, Ethan wondered if Maya saw something in him that he’d never seen in himself.  

---  

The next few days passed in a blur of quiet conversations, laughter, and stolen glances. Ethan couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this way—like every moment he spent with Maya was a thread weaving itself into something bigger, something he didn’t fully understand yet.  

He found himself looking forward to their time together more than he cared to admit. The coffee shop, the art studio, the walks across campus—it all felt like their own little world, separate from the chaos of deadlines and expectations.  

But with every passing day, the weight of his unspoken feelings grew heavier.  

One evening, as they walked through the campus park, Maya broke the comfortable silence with a question that caught Ethan off guard.  

“Do you ever think about the future?” she asked, her voice quiet but thoughtful.  

Ethan glanced at her, surprised. “The future?”  

“Yeah,” she said, kicking at a loose pebble on the path. “Like, where you’ll be in five years. Ten years. Who you’ll be with.”  

Ethan hesitated, unsure how to answer. He’d always thought about the future in practical terms—graduating, getting a job, finding stability. But lately, those plans felt incomplete, like something important was missing.  

“I guess I think about it sometimes,” he said finally. “But it’s hard to picture.”  

Maya nodded, her gaze distant. “Yeah. Same here. I mean, I know what I want to do, but… I don’t know if it’ll all work out the way I hope.”  

“You’ll figure it out,” Ethan said, his voice firm. “You’re too determined not to.”  

Maya smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thanks. I just… sometimes I wish things were simpler, you know? Like, instead of worrying about what comes next, we could just… be.”  

Ethan didn’t respond right away. He wasn’t sure what to say. All he knew was that in that moment, with the golden light of the setting sun casting a warm glow over her face, he wanted to tell her everything—how much she meant to him, how she’d changed his life in ways he couldn’t put into words.  

But the words wouldn’t come.  

Instead, they walked in silence, the air between them thick with everything left unsaid.  

---

That night, Ethan sat at his desk, staring at the blank screen of his laptop. He’d been trying to work on a project for hours, but his mind kept drifting back to Maya—her laugh, her smile, the way her voice softened when she talked about her dreams.  

Frustrated, he closed the laptop and leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair. He couldn’t keep doing this—pretending that his feelings didn’t exist, that he could keep their relationship neatly contained in the box of friendship.  

But what if telling her changed everything? What if it ruined the one thing in his life that felt real and steady?  

Ethan sighed, his chest tight with indecision. For someone who prided himself on logic and problem-solving, this was one equation he couldn’t seem to solve.  

All he knew was that he couldn’t keep going like this. Sooner or later, something had to give.  

---  

Ethan avoided Maya for the next two days.  

It wasn’t intentional, at least not at first. He told himself he needed to catch up on schoolwork, that the looming deadlines and assignments couldn’t wait. But deep down, he knew the truth. He was running—from his feelings, from the weight of everything he wanted to say but couldn’t.  

By the third day, Maya sent him a text:  

**Maya**: Did you fall off the face of the Earth, or are you just hiding?  

Ethan stared at the screen, his chest tightening. He could picture her smirking as she typed it, the playful lilt in her voice, the teasing glint in her eyes.  

After a long moment, he typed back:  

**Ethan**: Just busy.  

Her reply came almost instantly.  

**Maya**: Lame excuse. Coffee shop. 5 PM. Be there.  

Ethan exhaled slowly, the corner of his mouth lifting despite himself. Maya didn’t ask for much, but when she did, she made it hard to say no.

When Ethan arrived at the coffee shop later that evening, Maya was already there, her sketchbook open in front of her. She didn’t look up as he approached, her pencil moving across the page with quick, precise strokes.  

“Hey,” he said, sliding into the seat across from her.  

She glanced up, her expression unreadable. “You’re late.”  

“Sorry,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “Got caught up with something.”  

Maya studied him for a moment before setting her pencil down. “You’ve been avoiding me,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact.  

Ethan froze. “I haven’t—”  

“Don’t lie,” she interrupted, her tone gentle but firm. “It’s fine if you needed space, but at least be honest about it.”  

Ethan sighed, slumping back in his chair. “I wasn’t avoiding you,” he said quietly. “Not really. I just… I’ve had a lot on my mind.”  

Maya’s expression softened, and she leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand. “You want to talk about it?”  

Ethan hesitated. Part of him wanted to tell her everything—that she was the reason he couldn’t focus, that every time he saw her, it felt like the ground beneath him was shifting. But the other part of him was terrified of what might happen if he did.  

“It’s nothing,” he said finally, forcing a small smile. “Just school stuff.”  

Maya frowned but didn’t press him. Instead, she picked up her pencil and resumed sketching. For a while, they sat in silence, the familiar rhythm of their routine settling between them.  

But tonight, it felt different. The unspoken tension hung in the air, heavier than usual, and Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that Maya knew more than she was letting on.

Later, as they walked out together, Maya stopped suddenly, turning to face him.  

“Ethan,” she said, her voice quiet but steady.  

He looked at her, his heart pounding. “Yeah?”  

She hesitated, her gaze searching his. For a moment, it seemed like she was about to say something important, something that might shatter the fragile balance they’d been holding onto.  

But then she smiled—a small, wistful smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.  

“Never mind,” she said, stepping back. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”  

Ethan nodded, though the tightness in his chest didn’t ease. “Yeah. Tomorrow.”  

As he watched her walk away, he couldn’t help but wonder what she’d been about to say—and why a part of him was so afraid to hear it.

The next morning, Ethan woke up with a knot in his stomach.  

His mind kept replaying the way Maya had looked at him the night before—the hesitation in her eyes, the way her smile hadn’t quite reached her usual brightness. He couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d been holding back, just like he was.  

He wanted to believe that ignoring the growing tension between them would make it go away, but deep down, he knew better.  

By the time afternoon rolled around, Ethan found himself standing outside her studio, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. He wasn’t sure why he was there. He hadn’t texted or called ahead, and for all he knew, she might not even be there.  

But when he pushed open the door, the familiar scent of paint and lavender greeted him, and there she was—sitting cross-legged on the floor, her sketchbook balanced on her knees.  

Maya looked up as he entered, her expression surprised but not unwelcoming. “Ethan?”  

“Hey,” he said, his voice softer than he’d intended.  

She set her sketchbook aside, brushing her hands on her jeans as she stood. “What’s up? I thought we were meeting later.”  

“I know,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I just… needed to talk to you.”  

Maya tilted her head, studying him. “Okay,” she said, crossing her arms. “What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, his throat dry. The words were right there, just waiting to be said, but they felt impossibly heavy.  

“I—” He stopped, exhaling sharply. “I don’t know how to say this.”  

Maya’s expression softened, and she took a step closer. “Ethan, whatever it is, you can tell me. You know that, right?”  

Her words were gentle, but they only made the knot in his chest tighten. He looked at her—the way her hair fell in soft waves over her shoulders, the way her eyes held a mix of curiosity and concern—and something in him broke.  

“I’m scared,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya blinked, startled. “Scared? Of what?”  

“Of ruining this,” he admitted, gesturing vaguely between them. “Of saying the wrong thing and losing you.”  

Maya’s brow furrowed, and she stepped even closer, her gaze steady. “Ethan, you’re not going to lose me. Whatever it is, just say it.”  

He hesitated for a moment longer, then finally let the words spill out.  

“I care about you,” he said, his voice trembling. “More than I probably should. And it’s been driving me crazy because I don’t know how to handle it. I don’t want to mess this up, but I also can’t pretend like I don’t feel this way.”  

The silence that followed was deafening. Ethan’s heart pounded in his chest, every second stretching into an eternity as he waited for her response.  

Maya’s expression was unreadable, her gaze fixed on him. Then, slowly, a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips.  

“Ethan,” she said softly, “you really are terrible at hiding your feelings, you know that?”  

He blinked, caught off guard. “What?”  

She laughed lightly, the sound breaking the tension like sunlight piercing through clouds. “I’ve known for a while,” she admitted. “I was just waiting for you to figure it out.”  

Ethan stared at her, his mind racing. “You… knew?”  

Maya nodded, her smile growing. “And for the record, I care about you too. Probably more than I should.”  

Relief flooded through him, so overwhelming it was almost dizzying. He let out a shaky laugh, running a hand through his hair. “So… what now?”  

Maya tilted her head thoughtfully, her eyes sparkling with a mix of mischief and warmth. “Now,” she said, stepping closer, “we stop pretending.”  

Before Ethan could respond, she leaned in and wrapped her arms around him in a hug that felt like coming home.  

And for the first time in weeks, the weight in his chest lifted.  

Whatever happened next, they’d face it together.
