## Chapter 6: Quiet Distance (Continued)  

The days after their brief encounter felt heavier for Ethan. Seeing Maya had stirred something deep within him—a mixture of longing, regret, and a quiet hope that he didn’t fully understand.  

He tried to bury himself in his work, hoping the routine would numb the ache in his chest. But no matter how many hours he spent studying or how many assignments he completed, his thoughts always seemed to wander back to her.

Maya, too, found herself haunted by their conversation. She replayed it in her mind late at night, wondering if she’d made the right choice.  

She wanted to call him, to tell him how much she missed him, but something held her back. A quiet voice in the back of her mind reminded her why they’d needed the space in the first place.  

Instead, she turned to her art. Her paintings grew bolder, more expressive, as if she were trying to pour all her emotions onto the canvas. But even as the colors swirled and blended, she couldn’t escape the nagging feeling that something was missing.

One afternoon, Ethan wandered into the library, hoping to find a quiet corner to clear his head. As he scanned the shelves, his eyes landed on a familiar book—a collection of poems that Maya had once lent him during their first semester together.  

Without thinking, he pulled it off the shelf and flipped through the pages. Her favorite poem was still marked with a small, folded corner, and as Ethan read the lines, he felt a pang of nostalgia.  

“Do you remember when we read this together?”  

Ethan turned, startled, to see Maya standing a few feet away. Her expression was soft, her gaze lingering on the book in his hands.  

“Yeah,” Ethan said, his voice quiet. “You said it reminded you of us.”  

Maya smiled faintly, stepping closer. “It still does.”  

They stood there for a moment, the weight of their shared memories pressing down on them.  

“How have you been?” Ethan asked finally, breaking the silence.  

Maya hesitated, then shrugged. “Better. I’ve been painting a lot.”  

Ethan nodded. “That’s good. I’m glad.”  

“What about you?” she asked, her voice tentative.  

“I’ve been… figuring things out,” Ethan said. “It’s not easy, but I’m trying.”  

Maya’s gaze softened, and she reached out, her fingers brushing against his. “I’m proud of you, Ethan. I hope you know that.”  

Ethan’s chest tightened at her words, but he managed a small smile. “Thanks.”

That evening, as Ethan sat at his desk, he opened his journal and began to write:  

“She said she’s proud of me. I don’t know if I deserve it, but hearing those words felt like a lifeline. I’m still lost, but maybe that’s okay. Maybe being lost is part of the process. Maybe it means I’m still moving.”

The next time Maya walked into her studio, she found a small envelope tucked under the door. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded neatly.  

She unfolded it slowly, her heart racing as she read the words:  

“You’ve always been my inspiration, Maya. I don’t know where this journey will take us, but I hope, someday, our paths cross again in the way they’re meant to. Until then, I’ll keep walking.”  

Tears filled her eyes as she clutched the note to her chest.  

Ethan was still out there, finding his way. And so was she.  

For now, that was enough.
