## Chapter 2: Shared Worlds (Continued)  

The next afternoon, Ethan carried the painted canvas to Maya’s studio. He wasn’t sure what to expect—whether she’d laugh, offer pointers, or simply give him one of her trademark teasing smirks.  

When he walked through the door, Maya was sitting on the floor, surrounded by an explosion of colored paper and scraps of fabric. She looked up, her face lighting up when she saw him.  

“You brought it!” she said, scrambling to her feet. “Let me see.”  

Ethan hesitated, gripping the canvas a little tighter. “It’s not great,” he warned.  

“Let me be the judge of that,” Maya said, holding out her hands.  

Reluctantly, Ethan handed it to her, watching as her eyes scanned the swirling colors and jagged lines.  

For a moment, she didn’t say anything. Then, she looked up at him, her expression softer than he’d ever seen it.  

“Ethan,” she said quietly, “this is… incredible.”  

He blinked, caught off guard. “Really?”  

“Yes,” she said, her voice firm. “It’s raw and honest and so… you.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure how to respond. He’d spent so much time second-guessing himself, convinced that whatever he created couldn’t possibly measure up. But hearing Maya’s words, seeing the sincerity in her eyes, made something inside him shift.  

“Thanks,” he said finally, his voice soft.  

Maya smiled, setting the canvas down carefully. “You should do this more often,” she said.  

“What, painting?”  

“Yeah,” she said, nodding. “Not because you’re trying to be an artist, but because it makes you happy. And you deserve that.”  

Ethan looked at her, his chest tightening. “I’m not sure I’d call it happiness,” he admitted. “But it does feel… good. Like I’m letting something out.”  

Maya’s smile widened. “That’s the point.”

They spent the rest of the afternoon working side by side, Maya cutting and gluing pieces for a collage while Ethan started on another canvas.  

This time, he didn’t feel as hesitant. The colors came easier, the strokes more fluid. He didn’t worry about whether it looked good or made sense—he just let it happen.  

When he finally set the brush down, Maya glanced over, her eyes lighting up.  

“See?” she said, her tone teasing but warm. “I told you you’d get the hang of it.”  

Ethan laughed, shaking his head. “I don’t think I’ll ever ‘get the hang’ of it, but… it’s not as bad as I thought.”  

Maya grinned, leaning over to nudge his shoulder. “That’s progress.”

As the evening wore on, the conversation shifted to lighter topics—childhood memories, favorite movies, and embarrassing stories that left them both laughing until their sides ached.  

At one point, Maya turned to him, her expression thoughtful.  

“You know,” she said, “I think this is my favorite version of you.”  

Ethan raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”  

“This,” she said, gesturing to him. “Relaxed, open, not overthinking everything. It suits you.”  

Ethan smiled, a faint blush creeping up his neck. “I guess I have you to thank for that.”  

Maya’s smile softened. “I think it was always there,” she said. “You just needed someone to remind you.”  

The words stayed with Ethan long after he left the studio that night. For the first time, he felt like he was beginning to understand himself—not just who he was, but who he could be.  

And for that, he knew he had Maya to thank.
