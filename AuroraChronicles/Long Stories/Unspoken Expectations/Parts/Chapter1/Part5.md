## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths (Continued)  

Ethan didn’t think much about how quickly Maya had become a part of his life until Ryan noticed.  

“Okay, spill it,” Ryan said one afternoon, slapping his tray down on the table in the campus dining hall.  

Ethan frowned, barely looking up from his laptop. “Spill what?”  

“You’ve been acting weird,” Ryan said, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. “Like… less stressed, more distracted. You even skipped our study session last night, which, by the way, is very unlike you. What’s going on?”  

Ethan hesitated, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. Ryan wasn’t wrong. He *had* been distracted lately—by Maya, by her laughter, by the way her presence seemed to brighten even the dullest moments. But how could he explain that to Ryan without sounding ridiculous?  

“I’ve been busy,” Ethan said finally, his voice nonchalant.  

Ryan raised an eyebrow. “Busy with what? And don’t tell me it’s school because I know for a fact that you’re weeks ahead on all your assignments.”  

Ethan sighed, shutting his laptop with a soft click. “There’s this girl,” he admitted, his tone hesitant.  

Ryan’s eyes lit up, and a grin spread across his face. “A *girl*? Ethan, you dog! Who is she? How long has this been going on? Why am I just hearing about this now?”  

“It’s not like that,” Ethan said quickly, feeling his cheeks heat. “We’re just… friends.”  

“Uh-huh,” Ryan said, leaning back in his chair with a knowing smirk. “Sure you are.”  

Ethan didn’t bother arguing. Ryan wasn’t entirely wrong. There was something between him and Maya—something unspoken, fragile, and new. But he wasn’t sure if it was real, or if it was just his imagination running wild.  

Later that day, as he sat across from Maya in the coffee shop, Ryan’s words echoed in his mind.  

“So,” Maya said, snapping him out of his thoughts. “What’s on your mind today?”  

“Nothing,” Ethan said quickly, though the blush creeping up his neck betrayed him.  

Maya raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. “You’re a terrible liar, you know that?”  

Ethan chuckled softly, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just Ryan being… Ryan.”  

“Ah,” Maya said with a grin. “What did he say this time?”  

“He thinks we’re…” Ethan hesitated, unsure how to phrase it. “That we’re… more than friends.”  

Maya’s expression shifted, her teasing smile softening into something unreadable. For a moment, she didn’t say anything, and Ethan’s heart pounded in the silence.  

“And what do you think?” she asked finally, her voice quiet.  

Ethan opened his mouth to respond, but the words caught in his throat. What *did* he think? He wasn’t sure. All he knew was that being around Maya made him feel alive in a way he hadn’t felt in years.  

“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Maya’s lips curved into a faint smile, and she leaned back in her chair, her eyes thoughtful. “Well, I guess we’ll figure it out. No rush, right?”  

“Right,” Ethan said, though his chest tightened at the thought.  

They didn’t talk about it again that day, but the conversation lingered in Ethan’s mind long after they’d parted ways.  

That night, as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, he replayed her words over and over.  

No rush.  

But even as he tried to reassure himself, a quiet voice in the back of his mind whispered something else entirely:  

What if this was the beginning of something he couldn’t afford to lose?
