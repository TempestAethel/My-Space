# Unspoken Expectations  
*By Aurora Heart*  

## Chapter 1: Crossing Paths  

Ethan didn’t think much about the day when it began. It was one of those overcast mornings where the sun seemed too tired to push through the thick gray clouds. He adjusted the strap of his backpack, groaning inwardly at the weight of his textbooks, and shuffled into the bustling campus coffee shop.  

The café was alive with the usual noise: the hiss of the espresso machine, the murmur of students trading notes, and the occasional burst of laughter from a nearby table. Ethan didn’t belong to the loud crowd. He preferred the solitude of his laptop and the quiet corner seat that overlooked the courtyard. But today, someone else had taken it.  

She sat there, her sketchbook open, pencil moving furiously across the page. Loose strands of dark hair framed her face, and her brows furrowed in concentration. Ethan hesitated, unsure whether to interrupt. The corner seat wasn’t his by right, but he had claimed it often enough to feel a faint sense of ownership.  

“Looking for something?” her voice startled him. She glanced up, her eyes meeting his.  

“Uh, no. I mean, yes,” Ethan stammered, caught off guard. “I usually sit there.”  

“Oh,” she said, tilting her head. Her expression softened into an amused smile. “Territorial, are we? It’s a good spot, though. Can’t blame you for wanting it.”  

Ethan wasn’t sure whether to laugh or walk away. Instead, he gestured to the seat across from her. “Mind if I join you, then?”  

She paused, considering for a moment, before nodding. “Sure. But I warn you, I’m not great company when I’m working.”  

Ethan sat down, setting his bag on the floor and his laptop on the table. He tried not to stare as she resumed sketching, her pencil darting across the paper with an intensity that fascinated him. After a few moments of silence, curiosity got the better of him.  

“What are you working on?” he asked.  

She stopped, her hand hovering over the sketchbook. “Just… something for class,” she said vaguely, turning the page slightly so he couldn’t see. “You’re not an art student, are you?”  

Ethan shook his head. “Engineering.”  

“Figures,” she said with a small laugh. “You’ve got that ‘practical and logical’ look about you.”  

“And you’re the ‘creative and mysterious’ type?” he countered, surprising himself with his boldness.  

Her laughter was warm, disarming. “Maya,” she said, extending her hand.  

“Ethan,” he replied, shaking it.  

For the next hour, they shared the table in companionable silence. Ethan typed away at his project, while Maya sketched, occasionally muttering to herself about proportions and shadows. It was strange, Ethan thought, how comfortable it felt.  

When she finally packed up her things, she paused, looking at him thoughtfully. “You’re not so bad, Ethan. Maybe I’ll see you around.”  

Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving behind the faint scent of lavender and graphite. Ethan stared at the empty seat, a strange warmth spreading through his chest.  

He didn’t know it yet, but this small moment would mark the beginning of something that would change both their lives forever.
