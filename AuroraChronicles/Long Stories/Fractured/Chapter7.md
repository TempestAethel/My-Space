## **Chapter 7: Cracks in the Mirror (Part 1)**  

Avery jolted awake with a sharp gasp, drenched in sweat.  

The clearing, the swing set, the voice—it was gone.  

Instead, they were lying on something hard and cold. Their fingers scraped against a smooth surface as they pushed themselves upright, their breath ragged and shallow. Avery blinked rapidly, their vision blurry at first, before the world swam into focus.  

*The lab.*  

They were back in the lab.  

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, sterile glow. Around them, desks and monitors stood exactly where they had before—unmoved, untouched. The screens were dark, their blank reflections staring back. Papers lay scattered across the floor, caught in the drafts of unseen air.  

*Was it a dream?*  

Avery’s mind reeled as they staggered to their feet. The room felt *wrong* somehow, too still, too empty. Every sound echoed like they were trapped in a cavernous void.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice wavered, hoarse and uncertain.  

Silence.  

There was no sign of her.  

Avery turned in slow circles, scanning the room. The control console—where the looping signal had first gone haywire—sat at the far end of the room. It hummed faintly, its surface dotted with blinking lights. The hum wormed its way into Avery’s ears, persistent and relentless.  

*“The signal is feeding on me,”* Avery whispered to themselves. Their earlier realization returned like a punch to the gut. *This isn’t over. It’s not real.*  

Suddenly, a sharp sound broke the silence—a faint *drip… drip… drip*.  

Avery turned toward the source, dread curdling in their stomach.  

Across the room, a large mirror hung on the wall. It was framed in steel, its surface polished and clear. But something about it made Avery’s skin crawl.  

*Drip… drip.*  

There was blood running down the mirror’s surface—thin streaks of red crawling downward like veins. Avery’s chest tightened. Their feet moved on their own, drawn toward it despite every screaming instinct to *stop*.  

As they stepped closer, their reflection sharpened. Avery stopped just a foot away, staring at themselves.  

The person in the mirror looked like them—same tired eyes, same disheveled hair, same sweat-stained clothes—but there was something *off*.  

The reflection didn’t blink.  

Avery stared harder, their breath hitching. Slowly, the reflection tilted its head, an unnatural angle that sent a chill through Avery’s bones.  

“Who… who are you?” Avery whispered.  

The reflection smiled.  

A cruel, twisted smile.  

Avery staggered back, slamming into the console. The reflection didn’t move—it just stood there, grinning like a predator.  

Then, it spoke.  

“I’m you, Avery.”  

The voice was theirs—but wrong. Twisted, layered, dripping with malice.  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head violently. “No, you’re not.”  

The reflection stepped forward, pressing its hands against the inside of the mirror. Cracks splintered out from its palms, spiderwebbing across the surface. The sound of glass creaking and splitting filled the room, growing louder with every second.  

“You can’t run from yourself,” it said, its grin widening impossibly. “You never could.”  

The cracks deepened. Pieces of glass fell from the mirror, shattering on the floor at Avery’s feet.  

Avery’s pulse pounded in their ears as they turned and bolted toward the door. They grabbed the handle and yanked hard—locked.  

*No.*  

The sound behind them grew louder—the mirror groaning as if something was forcing its way through. Avery risked a glance over their shoulder and froze.  

The reflection was crawling out.  

It was pulling itself through the cracks, its body twisting and bending unnaturally as it emerged. Its movements were jerky, its limbs too long and sharp, its face a distorted version of Avery’s own.  

“Avery,” it hissed, its voice echoing in layers. “Let me in.”  

Avery’s mind screamed. They banged on the door with both fists, panic driving every motion. “Let me out! *Let me out!*”  

The creature—*their reflection*—was almost free. Its torso emerged, shoulders popping as they squeezed through the fractured glass.  

A metallic *click* echoed in the room. The door unlocked.  

Avery didn’t hesitate. They threw it open and sprinted out into the hallway beyond, their breath ragged and their heart threatening to burst.  

The hallway was just as they remembered it—white walls, flickering lights. But now it felt endless. No doors. No turns. Just a stretch of emptiness that seemed to stretch forever.  

Behind them, the sound of shattering glass erupted.  

*It’s coming.*  

Avery didn’t look back. They ran, their footsteps pounding against the floor, echoing endlessly. The hallway warped and shifted as they moved—walls bending, lights flickering like dying stars.  

Finally, up ahead, something appeared: a door.  

Avery pushed themselves harder, their lungs burning.  

The door loomed larger as they neared, a steel exit with a bright red handle. It stood out like a beacon against the shifting void. Avery reached for it, their fingers brushing the cold metal—  

The lights went out.  

Darkness swallowed everything.  

Avery froze, their hand still on the door handle. The air was silent.  

Then, a whisper.  

“You can’t escape yourself, Avery.”  

The voice came from everywhere—above, behind, beside them. Avery’s hand trembled as they gripped the handle tighter.  

The sound of footsteps echoed through the dark. Slow. Deliberate.  

It was here.  

Avery yanked the door open and threw themselves through it—  

And fell.  

---

Avery landed hard on cold concrete, the impact knocking the air from their lungs. Gasping, they pushed themselves up onto shaky arms.  

The darkness was gone.  

They were in another room—windowless, lit only by a faint flickering bulb overhead. It was empty except for a chair bolted to the center of the floor. Beside it sat a small metal table.  

And on the table sat a device.  

Avery’s heart stopped.  

The device was sleek, metallic, and compact—familiar and wrong all at once. It was the prototype. The memory manipulation device. The very project Avery had been building, the thing that had *started all of this*.  

They pushed themselves to their feet, their knees trembling.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, their voice breaking.  

The shadows around the room shifted, and a figure stepped into the light.  

Avery’s breath caught.  

It was *them*.  

The same reflection that had crawled out of the mirror, now standing upright and solid, its expression calm and cold. It smiled faintly, holding out its hand toward the device.  

“You know what you have to do,” it said softly.  

Avery stared, their mind spinning. “I—I don’t understand.”  

The reflection’s smile widened. “You made this. You can end this. Just sit down, Avery. It’s time to wake up.”  

Avery’s eyes flickered to the device. Their stomach churned as a wave of dread washed over them.  

They didn’t trust it. They didn’t trust *any* of this.  

But what choice did they have?  

The reflection stepped closer, its presence suffocating. “Sit, Avery.”  

The lights flickered. The walls seemed to close in.  

Slowly, Avery stepped toward the chair.

## **Chapter 7: Cracks in the Mirror (Part 2)**  

Avery stood frozen in front of the chair, staring at the memory device on the table. Its polished surface reflected the harsh, flickering light, a cruel gleam that made it seem alive—like it was *waiting*.  

“Sit down, Avery.”  

The voice came from behind, soft and patient. It was the reflection—the twisted version of themselves. Avery didn’t turn to look. They couldn’t. Their heart thundered in their chest, their breathing shallow.  

*This isn’t real.*  

They repeated the thought like a mantra, but the weight of the room, the cold of the chair, the oppressive presence of their double—it all felt too tangible to dismiss.  

“You built this,” the reflection continued, stepping closer. Its footsteps echoed unnaturally, bouncing around the room. “You wanted to fix things. To erase the pain.”  

Avery’s eyes stayed locked on the device. “This… this isn’t right. It’s not supposed to be like this.”  

“And yet, here we are,” the reflection replied calmly. “You’re the one who brought us here, Avery. You’re the one who set this in motion.”  

Avery clenched their fists. Their mind was reeling.  

How many layers deep were they now? The lab. The swing set. The forest. Now this—this *room*, this… prison. Every time Avery thought they had broken free, reality cracked again, dropping them deeper into a maze with no end.  

“Why?” Avery whispered, more to themselves than to the reflection. “Why is this happening?”  

“Because you refuse to face it.”  

The words struck Avery like a blow, sharp and cold.  

The reflection stepped into their peripheral vision, stopping just next to the table. It looked at Avery with those dark, hollow eyes—eyes that should have been familiar but were so utterly *wrong*. It reached out, resting its hand on the device.  

“You built this to erase your pain,” it said softly. “But the mind doesn’t forget. It buries. It fractures. It loops.”  

Avery shook their head, their voice breaking. “I didn’t mean for this.”  

“Didn’t you?”  

The reflection’s hand traced the edge of the device, its smile faint but cruel. “You promised them it would help. You promised *yourself* that it would make the world better. But all you did was run from yourself. And now you’re stuck. *We’re stuck.*”  

“I didn’t—” Avery stopped, choking on the words. “I didn’t *know* it would do this!”  

The reflection tilted its head, like a predator amused by its prey. “Didn’t you? Somewhere deep down, you knew the risks. You knew what would happen if the mind rejected the erasure. But you *wanted* to forget. So you turned yourself into the experiment.”  

Avery staggered back, the walls of the room closing in. The air felt thin, suffocating.  

“No… no, that’s not true.”  

“Isn’t it?”  

The reflection stepped closer, its tone hardening. “You’ve felt it, haven’t you? That ache. That hole where something used to be. That memory you couldn’t *quite* grasp. You did this to yourself, Avery. And now, you can’t escape.”  

Avery’s vision blurred as tears welled in their eyes. Their mind twisted and recoiled, fragments of memory flashing and breaking apart: the lab, the swing set, a child laughing, a scream.  

They fell to their knees. “Stop.”  

The reflection crouched beside them, its presence a suffocating weight. “There’s only one way out of this. Sit down. Use the device.”  

Avery looked up, trembling. “Why? So I can erase myself completely? So I forget all of this?”  

The reflection smiled faintly. “So you can wake up.”  

Avery froze.  

The words echoed in their mind, overlapping with the other whispers—the voices they’d heard in the fog, the distorted murmurs from the mirror.  

*“Wake up, Avery.”*  

The phrase struck something deep inside. A memory that wasn’t a memory—something older, buried beneath the fractures of their mind.  

“What does that mean?” Avery demanded, their voice ragged. “Wake up *where*? What’s real?”  

The reflection didn’t answer. It simply stood and gestured to the chair again.  

“Find out.”  

---

Avery’s hands shook as they gripped the arms of the chair. It was ice-cold against their skin, the metal biting through their clothes as they lowered themselves into it. Every instinct screamed at them to stop, to run, but there was nowhere left to go.  

The device sat on the table, humming faintly—alive, hungry.  

*Wake up.*  

The phrase whispered in the back of their mind. *Wake up.*  

Avery swallowed hard and reached for the device. Their fingers hovered over its surface.  

“Is this real?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

The reflection stood across from them, its face unreadable. “Real doesn’t matter anymore, Avery. Only the truth.”  

“What if I don’t want the truth?”  

The reflection smiled—an expression both cruel and kind. “You don’t have a choice.”  

Avery took a deep breath and closed their eyes.  

Their fingers pressed against the device, and everything went white.  

---

At first, there was nothing.  

No sound. No sight. No sensation. Just a vast, endless *void*.  

Then, slowly, a voice emerged.  

Soft. Gentle. Familiar.  

*“Avery. Can you hear me?”*  

The words rippled through the void like a pebble dropped in water. Avery’s mind grasped at them, desperate for an anchor.  

“Yes,” Avery whispered. “Where am I?”  

*“You’re safe,”* the voice replied. It was calm and soothing, but distant, like hearing someone speak from the other end of a tunnel.  

“Who are you?” Avery demanded.  

The voice hesitated.  

*“You know who I am.”*  

A flash of something—images bursting like sparks: Elise’s face, a lab, monitors glowing, a desperate warning.  

Avery’s chest tightened. “What’s happening to me?”  

The voice grew softer, almost mournful.  

*“You’re lost, Avery. But we’re trying to bring you back. You have to hold on.”*  

“Bring me back?” Avery whispered. “From what?”  

The void rippled violently, and a new sensation struck—pain. Sharp, searing, like something tearing through Avery’s mind.  

*“Hold on!”* the voice pleaded. “You’re almost there—just wake up!”  

The pain intensified. Avery screamed, their body arching as the void shattered around them like glass. Light exploded, blinding and overwhelming—  

And then—  

Darkness.
