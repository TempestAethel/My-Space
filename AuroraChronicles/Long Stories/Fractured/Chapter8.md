## **Chapter 8: The Threshold (Part 1)**  

Avery’s eyes snapped open.  

The first thing they felt was the cold—the sharp bite of icy air against their skin. Their body was sprawled on the ground, heavy and aching, as if they had fallen a great distance. Above, a single flickering light dangled from a fraying wire, swaying gently in the still air. The shadows it cast danced along the walls of the small, windowless room.  

*Not again.*  

Avery groaned, pushing themselves upright. Their muscles protested with every movement. The concrete beneath them was stained and cracked, and the room itself felt claustrophobic—like a box that was slowly shrinking around them.  

This wasn’t the lab. This wasn’t the mirror room. This was *somewhere else*.  

Avery’s head swam as they looked around, searching for answers, for clues, for *anything*.  

“Hello?” Their voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.  

No response. Just silence, heavy and suffocating.  

Then—  

*click… click… click.*  

The sound of footsteps echoed from somewhere beyond the walls. Slow, deliberate, and growing closer. Avery’s breath caught in their throat.  

“Who’s there?” they demanded, staggering to their feet. Their heartbeat thundered in their ears as they searched for an exit.  

There was only one door. A steel door, identical to the others Avery had encountered, with a small, grated window at the top. Avery stumbled toward it, grasping the handle and yanking hard. It didn’t budge.  

*Locked.*  

The footsteps grew louder. Closer.  

Avery’s mind spun, panic clawing at the edges of their thoughts. *What is this place? How many loops are there?* It was like falling deeper into an endless pit, one false reality after another, each layer more distorted than the last.  

Their eyes darted back to the grated window. Beyond it, the hallway was dark, the kind of pitch black that seemed alive—like it was waiting for something. Or someone.  

Suddenly, a shadow passed across the grate.  

Avery froze.  

“Who’s out there?” they whispered, dread settling deep in their bones.  

No response. Just the faint sound of breathing—heavy and uneven—on the other side of the door.  

Avery’s pulse spiked as they stepped back, their mind screaming at them to *move*.  

“Let me out!” They slammed their fists against the door. “*Let me out!*”  

The breathing on the other side stopped. For a moment, there was silence again.  

And then a voice—soft, distorted, and far too close.  

“Avery.”  

Avery’s blood ran cold. The voice was *theirs*.  

Slowly, they turned around.  

The room wasn’t empty anymore.  

In the far corner, sitting perfectly still, was *Avery*. Their double—the reflection—its face half-hidden in shadow. Its posture was relaxed, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. The smile stretched across its lips was cruel and knowing.  

“You can’t keep running,” it said softly.  

Avery backed away until they hit the cold steel door. “What do you want?”  

The double didn’t move. “It’s not what I want, Avery. It’s what *you* need.”  

“You’re not real!” Avery’s voice cracked, hysteria bubbling to the surface. “None of this is real!”  

The reflection’s smile widened as it rose to its feet. Its movements were smooth and deliberate, like a predator cornering its prey.  

“Are you sure?”  

Avery shook their head violently, tears welling in their eyes. “Stop this. Stop—*stop!*”  

The reflection ignored them, stepping closer. Its eyes—empty, black voids—fixed on Avery with a horrifying intensity.  

“You can’t hide from the truth,” it whispered. “It’s inside you. You built this prison, Avery. And now you’re trapped in it.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “No, I didn’t—”  

“Yes, you did.” The reflection’s voice grew sharper, louder, its tone echoing through the room. “You erased it. You ran. And now you’re *stuck.*”  

Avery’s knees buckled, their hands clutching their head as their mind fractured again—memories flashing like lightning: Elise shouting in the lab, the device sparking to life, the unbearable *noise*, the swing set, blood on their hands—  

*“Wake up, Avery.”*  

A scream tore itself from Avery’s throat.  

“Stop!”  

The reflection loomed closer, its face inches away now, its voice dropping to a whisper.  

“Wake up.”  

---

Suddenly, everything shattered.  

The walls, the floor, the ceiling—splintered into fragments, breaking apart like glass. Avery fell through the void, screaming as the pieces of reality spun around them. They were weightless, formless, plummeting deeper and deeper into nothingness.  

*“Wake up!”*  

The voice surrounded them now—Elise’s voice, the reflection’s voice, their own voice—melding together into a cacophony. Avery’s mind felt like it was splitting apart, every thought unraveling.  

And then—  

Light.  

Blinding, overwhelming light.  

Avery’s body hit solid ground with a brutal thud. Pain flared in their limbs as they groaned, forcing their eyes open.  

They were lying in the center of the lab.  

The real lab.  

Everything was still. Silent. The air smelled of chemicals and burnt wiring. Monitors blinked faintly, and the memory device sat on the table, dormant and lifeless.  

Avery sat up slowly, their entire body trembling.  

It felt real. It *looked* real. But could they trust it? Could they trust *anything*?  

From behind them, a voice broke the silence.  

“Avery?”  

Avery turned sharply.  

Elise was standing at the doorway, her face pale and wide-eyed. She looked *real*. Her voice trembled with worry.  

“Oh my god… Avery, you’re awake.”  

Avery stared at her, their heart pounding. “What… what’s happening?”  

Elise rushed forward, dropping to her knees beside them. “You’ve been out for hours. The machine… it overloaded. You—” She paused, taking a shaky breath. “We thought we’d lost you.”  

Avery’s head spun as they tried to process her words. “Hours?”  

Elise nodded, her expression earnest and afraid. “You weren’t responding. You… you kept muttering things—like you were trapped.”  

Avery stared at her, their mind screaming at them to *trust nothing*.  

“Is this real?” they whispered.  

Elise frowned. “Avery, what are you talking about? Of course this is real. It’s me. It’s—”  

“No!” Avery shot to their feet, backing away. “I don’t believe you. This is another loop. Another trick!”  

Elise’s face fell. “Avery… you need to calm down.”  

“Don’t tell me to calm down!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You’re lying. You’re not real. None of this is!”  

Elise rose to her feet slowly, her eyes filled with concern. “Avery… please.”  

Avery’s gaze darted around the lab. Everything looked *perfect*. Too perfect.  

*Too real.*  

Their mind splintered with doubt.  

Was this the truth? Or was it another illusion?

## **Chapter 8: The Threshold (Part 2)**  

Avery’s pulse pounded in their ears as the walls of the lab seemed to close in. Elise stood motionless, her expression frozen somewhere between concern and confusion, but Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that *something* was off. The edges of the room felt… sharp, too precise, like a painting where the brushstrokes hadn’t blended quite right.  

“Stop looking at me like that,” Avery muttered, their voice unsteady.  

Elise took a tentative step forward. “Avery, listen to me. You’ve been through a lot. You’re disoriented.” Her tone was calm, measured—too measured. “The machine overloaded. You’re just—confused.”  

The word sent a jolt through Avery’s mind. *Confused.* The same word Elise—or some version of her—had used in the swing set memory.  

“No,” Avery whispered, backing away, their hands trembling. “You’re not real. *This* isn’t real. I can feel it.”  

“Avery, please,” Elise pleaded, her voice wavering. “You need to trust me.”  

Avery’s eyes darted toward the memory device sitting dormant on the table. It looked harmless—innocent, even—but Avery *knew* better. That machine had been at the center of everything, every loop, every fracture in their mind.  

“Why is it still here?” Avery demanded, pointing a shaking finger at the device.  

Elise hesitated. “What do you mean?”  

“It’s off,” Avery said, their voice growing louder. “If it overloaded, why is it just sitting there? Why isn’t it damaged?”  

“I—” Elise’s mouth opened, but no words came out.  

Avery’s heart slammed against their ribs as the air in the room seemed to *thicken*. Elise’s presence suddenly felt wrong—like a puppet whose strings were beginning to fray.  

“Tell me where I am,” Avery growled, their voice low and desperate.  

Elise blinked once. Twice. Her eyes seemed to lose focus for a fraction of a second, like a glitch in a recording.  

“You’re safe, Avery,” she said, but her voice was *off* now—too smooth, too rehearsed.  

Avery staggered back, panic clawing at their throat. “No. No, you’re lying!”  

They grabbed the nearest thing they could find—a steel tray—and flung it across the room. It hit the ground with a deafening *clang*, the sound reverberating like thunder. Elise didn’t flinch. She didn’t even blink.  

“Wake up, Avery,” she said.  

Avery froze, their blood turning to ice.  

“What did you say?”  

Elise’s head tilted unnaturally to the side, her expression eerily serene. “Wake up, Avery. You can’t stay here.”  

The room began to shift—*warp*. The edges of the walls rippled, as if the entire lab were made of liquid glass. The lights flickered, the hum of the machines distorting into a low, droning growl.  

Avery clutched their head, their knees buckling under the weight of it. “Stop!”  

“You have to let go,” Elise’s voice echoed, layered and distorted now. “You can’t hold on to this anymore.”  

A sharp, splitting *crack* erupted through the air, and Avery screamed as the lab shattered like a mirror around them. The pieces of the room broke apart, floating and spinning into the void, leaving Avery suspended in a blinding white light.

When the light faded, Avery found themselves standing on solid ground again.  

But this time, they weren’t alone.  

The reflection—their double—stood a few feet away, watching them silently. The two of them were in an endless, empty space, the ground beneath them smooth and featureless.  

“You keep running,” the reflection said quietly. “But there’s nowhere left to go.”  

Avery’s chest heaved as they turned to face their double. “Why are you doing this?”  

The reflection shook its head, a faint smile tugging at the corner of its mouth. “You still don’t get it, do you?”  

“Get what?” Avery spat, their voice cracking.  

The reflection stepped closer, its hollow eyes locking onto Avery’s. “This isn’t about *me*. It’s about you.”  

Avery took a step back, their body trembling. “You’re not making any sense.”  

The reflection’s voice softened. “Think, Avery. Think about the *machine*. Think about why you built it. Why you wanted it to work so badly.”  

The machine. The device that had promised so much—relief, freedom, a way to erase pain.  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut as flashes of memory cut through their mind: Elise’s warnings, the swing set, the child’s laughter, the scream.  

The scream.  

A sob caught in Avery’s throat as realization clawed its way to the surface. “No.”  

“Yes,” the reflection whispered. “You erased it. You *erased* them.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, tears spilling down their cheeks. “I didn’t mean to.”  

“But you did,” the reflection said gently. “You built the machine to forget. To bury the truth. To hide from your guilt. But the mind doesn’t forget, Avery. It just fractures.”  

Avery sank to their knees, their body shaking with the weight of the words. “I didn’t want to remember. I couldn’t—”  

“I know,” the reflection said softly. “But running doesn’t make it go away. It only makes the pain worse.”  

Avery looked up at their double, tears blurring their vision. “Then what do I do?”  

The reflection knelt beside them, its voice barely above a whisper. “You wake up.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their entire body trembling. “What if I don’t want to?”  

The reflection’s expression softened, a faint trace of compassion flickering in its dark eyes. “Then you’ll stay here. Trapped. Forever.”  

Avery stared at the reflection, the weight of the choice settling in their chest like a stone.  

Wake up. Face the truth.  

Or stay here, lost in the loops of their own creation.  

Their voice broke as they whispered, “How do I wake up?”  

The reflection held out its hand. “You already know.”  

Avery hesitated, their heart pounding. Slowly, they reached out, their fingers brushing against the reflection’s outstretched hand—  

And everything went dark.
