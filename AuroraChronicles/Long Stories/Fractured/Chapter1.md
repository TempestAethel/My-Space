## **Chapter 1: The Experiment (Part 1)**  

The sterile hum of fluorescent lights buzzed faintly above, their monotonous drone amplified by the suffocating silence of the lab. Avery Sinclair stared at the device resting on the table before them—a polished metal cylinder, no larger than a coffee thermos, cradled in a tangle of wires and blinking LEDs. It was unassuming, almost banal in appearance, yet it held within it the culmination of five grueling years of research.  

Avery’s hands trembled as they adjusted the settings on the console. The screen reflected back their face: hollow eyes rimmed with dark circles, lips pressed into a thin, grim line. They hadn’t slept properly in days, and even now, their mind felt like a clenched fist, too tense to unfurl. Yet, this was it. The moment they had dreamed of, worked for, sacrificed for. The Memory Erasure and Rehabilitation Interface—the MERI Device—was ready for its first human test.  

“Subject calibration complete,” came the automated voice of the lab’s AI system, breaking the tension. The sound was smooth, clinical, devoid of emotion. “Awaiting final authorization.”  

Avery hesitated, their hand hovering over the console’s activation switch. The room felt suddenly too small, too quiet, as if the walls were leaning inward.  

“Everything’s in place, Avery,” Dr. Elise Grant said from across the room, her voice calm and precise. She was a tall woman, composed and meticulous, the type who could deliver a grim prognosis without breaking her stride. “We’ve triple-checked every parameter. If there’s a time to take the leap, it’s now.”  

Avery glanced at her, searching for reassurance in her sharp blue eyes. Elise’s presence had always been a grounding force, a counterweight to the chaos swirling inside Avery’s mind. But today, even Elise seemed strained, her usually unflappable demeanor fraying at the edges.  

“I know,” Avery replied, their voice thin, almost brittle. “It’s just… once we do this, there’s no turning back.”  

Elise tilted her head, studying Avery with a mixture of sympathy and impatience. “You’ve said it yourself—countless times. The potential outweighs the risks. Think of what this could mean for people suffering from trauma. Soldiers with PTSD, survivors of abuse. This is the future, Avery. Your future.”  

Avery nodded, their throat tightening. The words were familiar, comforting even, but they rang hollow now. The idealism that had driven them for years felt paper-thin, worn down by the weight of doubt.  

They turned back to the console, focusing on the blinking cursor awaiting their command.  

“Final subject approval required,” the AI repeated, its monotone voice slicing through the tension.  

The subject was Avery. They had volunteered for the first human trial—partly because they trusted no one else to take the risk, and partly because of the nagging guilt festering inside them. If anyone should shoulder the consequences of failure, it was the device’s creator.  

Avery’s finger hovered over the touchpad, hesitating for a fraction of a second. Then, with a sharp inhale, they pressed the confirmation button.  

“Authorization received. Initializing neural interface.”  

The device emitted a low hum, a vibration so subtle it was more felt than heard. Avery lowered themselves into the sleek chair at the center of the room, their head pressing back against the neural interface. A series of small mechanical arms extended, gently positioning electrodes along their temples and the base of their skull.  

“Stay still,” Elise instructed, her voice quieter now. “You’ll feel a slight pressure as the system synchronizes.”  

Avery braced themselves, gripping the armrests tightly. The first sensation was strange but not painful—a faint buzzing at the edge of their awareness, like static creeping into the corners of their mind.  

Then came the memories.  

They unfolded in sharp, vivid flashes, cascading one after another like a deck of cards being shuffled too fast. Childhood laughter, muffled sobs, the sound of shattering glass. A moment of joy at their university graduation, immediately overwritten by the gut-wrenching grief of standing in the rain at their father’s funeral. Each memory was crisp, painfully detailed, and entirely out of their control.  

“The interface is functioning,” Elise said, her voice a distant echo in Avery’s ears. “Cognitive activity is within expected parameters.”  

Avery’s breathing quickened as the memories became more fragmented, less coherent. Colors and sounds overlapped, forming surreal, nightmarish images. A glowing red sky. A faceless figure in a lab coat. A child’s laughter dissolving into an ear-piercing scream.  

“Elise—” Avery gasped, their voice trembling. “Something’s not right.”  

“Elise, monitor spike in neural feedback,” the AI interjected.  

Elise’s calm façade slipped for a moment, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she analyzed the data streaming across the console. “Your levels are spiking. Try to stay calm, Avery. I’m adjusting the parameters—”  

But Avery could barely hear her now. The hum of the device grew louder, resonating deep within their skull. The images came faster, more jumbled, each one tearing through their mind like shards of glass. They saw themselves in the lab, standing at the console. Then they were a child again, crying out for someone they couldn’t remember. Then—  

Everything went dark.

## **Chapter 1: The Experiment (Part 2)**  

Avery’s senses returned in pieces, as though they had been submerged underwater and were now struggling to break the surface. First, there was sound—the distant murmur of a voice, muffled and indistinct. Then came light, sharp and blinding, forcing their eyelids to flutter shut again. A dull ache radiated through their skull, a throbbing pulse synchronized with their heartbeat.  

“—Avery! Can you hear me?” Elise’s voice cut through the haze, sharp with urgency.  

Avery forced their eyes open, blinking against the harsh fluorescent lights. The lab came into focus in disjointed fragments: the blinking lights of the console, Elise’s pale, drawn face hovering above them, and the device—silent now, its once-blinking LEDs ominously dark.  

“What… what happened?” Avery croaked, their throat dry and raw.  

“You blacked out,” Elise said, her voice tight. “The neural interface overloaded. I had to shut it down manually.”  

Avery sat up too quickly, their head spinning from the effort. “Overloaded? How? We triple-checked the parameters—”  

“I know,” Elise interrupted, her tone sharp with frustration. “But something went wrong. Your neural activity spiked far beyond what the system was designed to handle. You’re lucky you didn’t fry your entire prefrontal cortex.”  

Her words lingered, heavy and foreboding, but Avery barely registered them. Their mind was still grappling with the aftershocks of the experience—the vivid, fragmented memories that had surged through them like a tidal wave. Even now, scraps of them lingered on the edge of their consciousness: the sound of a child’s laughter, the faceless figure, the unbearable sensation of being both here and not here.  

“Elise,” Avery said slowly, their voice trembling, “it wasn’t just the memories. Something… something else was there.”  

Elise’s brows furrowed. “What do you mean?”  

Avery shook their head, struggling to find the words. “It was like… I wasn’t alone. There was something—or someone—in my head. Watching me.”  

The silence that followed was suffocating. Elise stared at Avery, her expression a mixture of disbelief and concern.  

“Avery,” she began carefully, “what you experienced was most likely a result of neural overload. Hallucinations, intrusive thoughts—those are all documented side effects of memory interface disruption. There was no one else in your head.”  

But Avery wasn’t convinced. The sensation had been too vivid, too real to dismiss as a mere side effect. They could still feel it, like a shadow lingering at the edge of their awareness.  

“Elise, I need the data from the test,” Avery said, their voice firmer now. “Every neural reading, every log. I need to know what happened.”  

Elise hesitated, glancing at the console. “Avery, I really think you should take some time to rest. This was—”  

“I don’t need rest!” Avery snapped, the sudden anger surprising them both. Their hands were shaking, their breath coming too fast. They closed their eyes, forcing themselves to steady their voice. “I need answers, Elise. Please.”  

For a long moment, Elise didn’t move. Then, with a reluctant sigh, she nodded and turned back to the console. Her fingers moved quickly across the keyboard, pulling up the data from the test.  

Avery leaned forward, scanning the streams of numbers and graphs that filled the screen. Neural activity charts spiked violently, far beyond the safe thresholds they had established. The feedback loop that had caused the system to crash was clear, but it didn’t explain the vividness of what Avery had experienced—or the lingering sense of unease that gnawed at them now.  

And then Avery saw it.  

“Wait,” they said, pointing to a section of the log. “What is that?”  

Elise frowned, following Avery’s gaze. “That… shouldn’t be there,” she murmured, her tone shifting to one of confusion.  

On the screen was an anomaly—an unrecognizable signal buried within the neural feedback data. It pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, like a heartbeat.  

“Is it interference?” Elise suggested, though her voice lacked conviction.  

Avery shook their head. “No. It’s too structured. Too deliberate.”  

A chill crept down their spine as they stared at the strange signal. It was as though it were alive, a ghost in the machine, lingering within the device’s neural pathways.  

“Elise,” Avery said slowly, their voice barely above a whisper, “what if this isn’t interference? What if the device… recorded something?”  

Elise froze, her eyes darting between Avery and the console. “Recorded what?”  

Avery didn’t answer immediately. Their mind raced with possibilities, each one more unsettling than the last. The MERI Device wasn’t designed to record memories—it was meant to erase them, to overwrite trauma with empty, painless gaps. And yet, staring at the strange pulse on the screen, Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been left behind.  

“Play it,” Avery said suddenly, their voice cutting through the tense silence.  

Elise hesitated, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. “Avery, we don’t even know what it is—”  

“Play it,” Avery insisted, their tone leaving no room for argument.  

With a reluctant nod, Elise entered the command. The lab filled with a crackling sound, sharp and uneven, like static on a broken radio. Then came the voice.  

Avery’s blood ran cold.  

It was their voice.  

“Who… who are you?” the recording stuttered, distorted but unmistakably their own.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. They didn’t remember saying those words during the test.  

The static crackled again, louder this time, as though something—or someone—were struggling to break through. Then came the reply, faint but chilling:  

“You already know.”  

The lab fell into silence, the words hanging in the air like a curse. Elise turned to Avery, her face pale and unreadable.  

“What the hell was that?” she whispered.  

Avery didn’t answer. They couldn’t. Their mind was too busy reeling from the realization that whatever had happened during the test wasn’t over.  

And whatever was in the device… wasn’t gone.
