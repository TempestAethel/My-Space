## **Chapter 4: The First Loop (Part 1)**  

The black screen reflected Avery’s pale face, the faceless figure burned into their mind like an afterimage. It wasn’t just a glitch. It couldn’t be. Elise sat stiffly next to them, her hands frozen mid-type as though afraid to move. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The hum of the machines remained dead, as if the lab itself was holding its breath.  

“I need some air,” Avery said, standing up abruptly. The words came out hollow, barely audible, but Elise didn’t stop them. She looked as shaken as Avery felt.  

Stepping outside the lab, Avery sucked in a deep breath of cool, stale air. The corridor outside the private lab stretched dimly ahead, sterile lights flickering slightly. They leaned against the wall, closing their eyes, trying to center themselves, but the silence wasn’t helping.  

*You shouldn’t be here.*  

The sentence echoed in their head over and over again, as though someone had carved it into their skull. The figure’s blank silhouette flashed every time Avery tried to clear their mind, filling the gaps in their memory with something darker.  

When they opened their eyes, the corridor looked… *off*.  

The shadows pooled deeper in the corners, and the lights buzzed faintly—an unnatural hum that hadn’t been there moments ago. Avery turned, glancing behind them, but the door to the lab was gone.  

Panic gripped their chest. They looked forward again. The corridor stretched impossibly long now, fading into darkness.  

“What the hell…” Avery whispered. Their voice felt small in the vast silence.  

They took a tentative step forward, unsure if they were imagining this—if their mind was betraying them. Each step echoed too loudly, like the sound was bouncing off unseen walls. The hum of the lights grew louder. The shadows seemed to shift, creeping forward.  

*Avery,* a voice whispered.  

Avery froze mid-step. The voice was soft but clear, spoken as though someone stood right behind them. Slowly, stiffly, they turned around.  

The faceless figure was there.  

Its presence sucked the air out of the corridor, its featureless head tilted slightly as if observing Avery. They stumbled back, their heart slamming in their chest. “Who are you?!” Avery demanded, their voice trembling.  

The figure didn’t move, didn’t answer. It simply *stood there*, as though waiting.  

Avery spun back around and sprinted down the corridor. They didn’t know where they were going, only that they had to move—had to escape. The sound of their footsteps quickened, mixing with the lights’ unnatural buzz.  

Then they slammed to a halt.  

The door to the lab was in front of them again.  

Avery stared, panting, sweat dripping down the side of their face. It didn’t make sense. They had run straight ahead. How could they be back where they started?  

Gritting their teeth, they grabbed the door handle and flung it open, expecting to see Elise, expecting to see the lab as they’d left it.  

But what they saw stopped them cold.  

---

The lab looked the same at first glance—same equipment, same sterile walls—but there was something *wrong*. Elise sat at the terminal, her back to Avery, the screen flickering with static. The sound of typing filled the room—*tap, tap, tap*. Avery stepped inside cautiously, their pulse hammering.  

“Elise?”  

The typing stopped. The silence pressed in. Elise’s head tilted slightly, but she didn’t turn around.  

Avery took another step forward. “Elise, are you—”  

Elise’s head snapped around too quickly, the motion unnatural, like a puppet on strings. Her face was blank. *Faceless.*  

Avery gasped and stumbled backward, hitting a metal cart. The sound echoed through the lab, but Elise didn’t move. She just *sat there*, facing them with her empty face.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered, clutching the edge of the cart. “It’s not real. It’s not real.”  

The lights flickered violently, and the walls seemed to close in, bending and warping like they were made of liquid. Avery squeezed their eyes shut. “Wake up. Wake up!”  

The hum of the equipment built into a roar, louder and louder, until Avery’s ears rang.  

Then everything went silent.  

When Avery opened their eyes again, they were lying on the cold floor of the lab. The lights were steady. The machines hummed quietly, just as they had before.  

Elise stood over them, her expression tight with concern. “Avery? What the hell just happened?”  

Avery sat up, their head spinning. “I… I don’t know.”  

Elise helped them to their feet, her brow furrowed. “One minute you stepped out, and the next, I found you passed out on the floor. Did you hit your head?”  

Avery shook their head, though the motion made them dizzy. “No. I—I saw something. The figure. It was here.”  

Elise’s expression darkened. “You mean… the one from the screen?”  

“Yes,” Avery whispered. Their voice wavered as they looked around the lab, but everything seemed normal now. “I ran down the hallway… but it was endless. And then… you—”  

“You’re not making any sense.” Elise grabbed Avery’s arm gently, trying to steady them. “You’re exhausted. This whole thing—it’s breaking you down. You need to rest before you crack wide open.”  

“It wasn’t a dream,” Avery snapped, yanking their arm away. “It happened. I know it did.”  

Elise frowned but didn’t argue. She looked at the terminal warily, as if expecting it to blink to life again. “What’s happening to us, Avery? What the hell is this?”  

Avery rubbed their temples, feeling the beginnings of a migraine clawing at their skull. “I don’t know. But I think we’re in it now. Whatever ‘it’ is.”  

Elise stared at them for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “If that’s true… then we’re going to need answers. Fast.”  

Avery looked at the dark monitor, their heart still racing. *You shouldn’t be here.*  

The words repeated in their mind like a curse.  

But Avery knew the truth.  

Wherever “here” was—whatever trap they had fallen into—there was no turning back now.

## **Chapter 4: The First Loop (Part 2)**  

Avery paced the length of the lab, their movements restless, frantic. The events from moments ago—or was it hours?—refused to settle in their mind. Elise sat silently by the console, her gaze flickering nervously between Avery and the dark screen. Neither of them said much since Avery had woken up, the tension filling every corner of the room like a toxic gas.  

“Endless corridors. A faceless figure. You collapsing.” Elise finally broke the silence, though her voice was quiet, careful. “Avery, are you *absolutely* sure it wasn’t… a stress response? A hallucination?”  

Avery whirled to face her, anger and desperation flashing in their eyes. “It wasn’t a hallucination, Elise. I *know* what I saw.”  

Elise didn’t argue, but Avery could see the doubt etched into her face. It stung. “We’ve been under immense pressure. The project, the anomaly, Marcus—your mind might be…” She trailed off, reluctant to finish.  

“Breaking?” Avery said bitterly, completing the thought. “That what you think?”  

Elise hesitated, her mouth pressed into a thin line. “I think we’ve crossed a line somewhere, Avery. And maybe whatever’s happening… maybe our minds aren’t equipped to handle it.”  

Avery turned away, squeezing their temples, the throbbing ache still there. “That doesn’t explain the code. Or the figure. Or the—”  

The monitor blinked on.  

A sharp *ping* echoed through the lab, freezing them both.  

Elise shot to her feet. “What the—?”  

Avery turned slowly, every nerve in their body on edge. The screen was active again, but this time, there were no distorted words, no static. Just an image.  

It was the lab. *This* lab.  

But Avery wasn’t in the frame. Elise wasn’t in the frame. Instead, there was a version of Avery sitting at the console, their back hunched, their hands trembling as they typed. The camera seemed fixed, like someone—or *something*—was watching them from a corner of the room.  

“What the hell is this?” Elise whispered.  

Avery stared, a sick feeling rising in their gut. “It’s me. But that’s not *me*. I didn’t—”  

The figure on the screen stopped typing. Slowly, it turned its head toward the camera. Its face came into view, and Avery’s blood turned to ice.  

It was their face. Identical in every way, except for the eyes. The eyes were black—bottomless pits that reflected nothing.  

And then, the other Avery smiled.  

The lights flickered violently, plunging the lab into brief darkness. Elise let out a sharp breath, fear breaking through her calm exterior. “Avery, shut it off. Shut it *off!*”  

Avery snapped out of their trance and lunged for the console. Their fingers flew across the keyboard, desperate to kill the feed. “Come on, come on!”  

The image froze for a second—Avery’s doppelgänger still smiling that unnatural smile. Then the screen went black with a sharp *snap*.  

The hum of the equipment returned, quieter now, almost apologetic, as if the room itself knew it had overstepped. Avery sagged forward, their hands trembling on the console.  

“What was that?” Elise asked hoarsely, her voice shaking.  

Avery didn’t answer. They couldn’t. The version of themselves on that screen, with those black, hollow eyes… it hadn’t felt like a glitch. It hadn’t felt random.  

It had felt like a warning.

Elise handed Avery a cup of water, her hands only slightly steadier than Avery’s. “This isn’t just an anomaly. This is something *else*. Something invasive. It’s like…” She paused, searching for the right words. “Like it’s *alive*.”  

Avery sipped the water without tasting it, their mind reeling. “Marcus said the Corporation was using the device for something darker. What if this—what we’re seeing—is part of it? What if the technology is altering our perceptions, making us *see* things that aren’t there?”  

“Then why the hell are we seeing the same thing?” Elise shot back, her voice sharp. “If it were all in your head, I wouldn’t have seen that video just now. You wouldn’t have collapsed.”  

Avery’s head swam with possibilities, none of them good. “Maybe it’s spreading,” they murmured. “Like a virus. Or maybe…” They trailed off, unwilling to finish the thought.  

Elise leaned forward. “Maybe *what*, Avery?”  

Avery’s mouth felt dry as they finally said it aloud. “Maybe we’re already inside it. The loop. The signal. Whatever it is—it’s got us.”  

Elise’s face paled, but she didn’t argue.  

*The first loop.*  

The words crawled through Avery’s mind, an intrusive thought that refused to leave. They looked around the lab, half-expecting the shadows to start creeping again, half-expecting the faceless figure to reappear.  

The door to the lab creaked open.  

Both Avery and Elise jumped, turning sharply toward the sound.  

Marcus stood there, framed by the dim light of the corridor. He looked disheveled, his hair sticking up in odd angles, as if he’d been running. “You need to come with me,” he said urgently.  

Avery stared at him. “How did you get in here?”  

Marcus didn’t answer. “There’s no time to explain. *They* know where you are. If we stay here, it’ll start all over again.”  

“What?” Elise snapped. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus glanced nervously down the corridor. “The loop, Elise. It’s happening. The first one is always the hardest to escape. But we *can* escape it.” He looked back at Avery, his gaze sharp and focused. “Trust me.”  

Avery hesitated, the words feeling heavy in the air. *Trust me.*  

The lab felt too small now, the walls too close. They could feel the presence of the signal, lurking just outside of their awareness, waiting.  

Elise looked at Avery. “What do we do?”  

Marcus took a step into the room. “You don’t have much time.”  

Avery’s mind screamed with indecision, but instinct pushed them forward.  

“Let’s go,” they said.  

Elise swore under her breath but followed as Marcus led them out into the corridor. The lights buzzed overhead as they hurried down the passageway. Avery glanced back once, half-expecting to see their faceless figure—or worse, their smiling doppelgänger—watching them.  

But the corridor was empty. For now.  

---

The elevator doors closed, the mechanical hum filling the silence as they descended. Marcus leaned against the wall, his breath ragged, his face pale.  

“You were right,” Avery finally said, breaking the quiet. “The signal… the device. It’s alive.”  

Marcus nodded grimly. “It’s just starting, Avery. And we’re not the only ones it’s watching.”  

“What do you mean?” Elise asked sharply.  

Marcus met their eyes, his expression dark. “I mean it’s already rewriting reality. For all of us.”  

The elevator shuddered violently, and the lights blinked out.  

*The loop begins again.*
