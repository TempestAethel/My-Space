## **Chapter 20: Breaking Point (Part 1)**  

The light was blinding at first—cold and sterile—like the dawn after a long, endless night. Avery stumbled through the doorway, their legs unsteady, their mind still buzzing with the echoes of the machine’s hum.  

The lab door shut behind them with a low *thud*, leaving only silence.  

Avery squinted, shielding their eyes as they took in their surroundings. It wasn’t the lab anymore. It wasn’t the void. They stood in a corridor—familiar yet strange—its white walls stretching infinitely in either direction. The lights overhead buzzed faintly, and the air smelled of antiseptic and metal.  

“Where am I now?” Avery whispered to themselves, their voice small and trembling.  

Their footsteps echoed as they moved forward, the corridor narrowing ever so slightly with each step, the walls pressing closer. Avery reached out, their fingertips brushing the cold, smooth surface—too smooth. Like it wasn’t real.  

A door appeared at the end of the hallway, a single gray rectangle embedded in the wall. It had no handle, no window—just a faint, pulsing glow at its center. Avery’s stomach twisted as they approached it, dread pooling deep in their chest.  

“Another trick,” they muttered, their teeth clenched. “It’s just another trick.”  

But when they reached the door, it slid open with a soft hiss. The glow intensified, spilling into the hallway like liquid light, forcing Avery to squint. They hesitated, the warmth brushing against their skin, inviting and unnatural all at once.  

*“You already know.”*  

The whisper came from nowhere and everywhere, twisting in Avery’s mind like a knife.  

“No,” Avery growled, their fists clenched. “I’m not playing your games anymore.”  

They stepped through the doorway, bracing themselves for whatever lay on the other side.

The room beyond was vast, impossibly large, its ceiling lost in shadow. Monitors stretched across the far wall, each screen flickering with fragmented images—Avery’s memories. The lab. Elise. Marcus. The child’s laughter. Lena’s smile.  

It was all there, fractured and looping, scenes playing over and over like a broken reel of film.  

At the center of the room stood the machine.  

The MERI Device.  

It sat on a raised platform, humming softly, its polished surface gleaming in the cold light. Its presence filled the room—*alive*, watchful—as though it had been waiting for Avery all along.  

Avery’s breath caught as they stepped closer, their heart pounding in their chest. “This is it,” they whispered. “This is where it started.”  

And where it would end.  

“Why did you bring me back here?” Avery shouted, their voice echoing through the cavernous room. “What do you want from me?”  

The screens flickered, their images distorting, and the hum of the machine deepened—almost like it was responding. The ground trembled faintly beneath Avery’s feet as shadows pooled along the edges of the room.  

From the darkness, a figure emerged.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stepped forward slowly, its black eyes fixed on Avery, its form perfectly still except for the faint ripple along its edges—like a projection struggling to hold its shape.  

“You made it,” the figure said softly, its voice layered and hollow.  

Avery’s fists tightened. “You again,” they spat. “What do you want from me?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, tilting its head. “I don’t want anything, Avery. *You’re* the one who keeps coming back. You’re the one who can’t let go.”  

“I didn’t choose this!” Avery shot back, their voice shaking with fury. “I didn’t choose *any* of this!”  

The figure’s smile faded. “Didn’t you?”  

The screens on the walls pulsed brighter, their images shifting to one single moment—Avery at the console, their hands trembling over the controls as they activated the device for the first time. Elise and Marcus in the background, their faces a blur of concern and fear.  

The doppelgänger gestured toward the screens. “You built the machine. You turned it on. You ignored the warnings. All of this—every fracture, every shadow, every loop—is your creation.”  

Avery stumbled back, shaking their head violently. “No. I didn’t know what it would do.”  

“You knew enough,” the doppelgänger said sharply, their voice darkening. “You told yourself it was for the greater good. You told yourself it would help people. But it was never about them, was it?”  

Avery froze, their breath caught in their chest. “What are you talking about?”  

The doppelgänger stepped closer, their black eyes burning. “It was always about you. About your pain. Your guilt. You wanted to forget, Avery. You wanted to erase *yourself.*”  

“No,” Avery whispered, tears pooling in their eyes. “That’s not true.”  

The room trembled, the hum of the machine rising like a storm. The doppelgänger’s voice echoed, filling the space, each word a dagger.  

“You built the perfect trap. A machine that could erase memories, rewrite reality—and now you’re stuck inside it, running from the truth. *Running from yourself.*”  

Avery sank to their knees, their body shaking as the words tore through them. The screens flashed images faster now, scenes blurring together—Lena’s smile, Lena’s death, the device humming to life, the void swallowing them whole.  

“You let me in,” the doppelgänger whispered, crouching before Avery. “And now I’m all that’s left.”  

The machine’s hum grew deafening, vibrating through Avery’s bones as the room flickered and glitched. The ground cracked beneath them, threads of light spilling through the fractures, pulling the space apart.  

Avery clutched their head, sobbing. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t—”  

“But you did,” the figure said softly, its voice calm now, final. “You can’t run from it anymore, Avery. You have to choose.”  

The ground split open, and the machine blazed with light, its hum a roar that filled every corner of the room. Avery looked up, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the glow.  

“Choose what?” they gasped.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, its form starting to dissolve into the light. “To let go… or to stay trapped.”  

The room shuddered violently, the cracks widening, the light blinding as it swallowed everything. Avery screamed as the ground fell away, the hum of the machine rising into a crescendo—  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

Avery opened their eyes.  

They were back in the lab.  

The device sat before them, silent and polished, as though it had never been touched. The console screen glowed faintly, waiting.  

Avery stared at it, their breath trembling. They reached out with shaking hands, their fingers hovering over the controls.  

*Choose.*  

The hum of the machine lingered softly, a whisper now, waiting for their answer.  

“Let go,” Avery murmured to themselves, their voice unsteady.  

They stared at the screen, their reflection staring back at them.  

And slowly, they made their choice.

## **Chapter 20: Breaking Point (Part 2)**  

The hum of the machine grew louder, pressing into Avery’s skull like invisible fingers. The faint glow of the console illuminated their pale face, their reflection flickering in the glassy surface.  

*Choose.*  

The doppelgänger’s voice echoed in Avery’s mind, soft but unrelenting. *To let go… or to stay trapped.*  

Avery’s hand trembled as it hovered over the console. “What happens if I let go?” they whispered, though they already knew there would be no answer.  

The lab was silent, waiting.  

Avery staggered back, their breath ragged as they turned to look around the room. The walls flickered faintly, cracks spiderwebbing through the edges of reality, the same light bleeding through that Avery had seen in the void. It was all coming apart now, fraying like the edge of a tattered rope.  

And they were at its center.  

Their mind was splitting—each fragment trying to pull them in a different direction.  

Stay. Let go. Choose.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery muttered, their voice raw, as though trying to remind themselves. “None of this is real.”  

But was it?  

The thought slithered into their mind like a shadow, spreading doubt. It felt real—the hum, the ache, the weight of the choice before them. Every fragment, every memory, every voice—they were all real in the ways that mattered.  

And wasn’t that the point?  

“Is this who I am now?” Avery whispered to the empty lab, their voice trembling. “A loop? A glitch?”  

The machine didn’t respond, but the hum deepened, vibrating through the floor like the thrum of a heartbeat.  

Avery turned back toward the console, staring at the faint glow of the screen. A single line of text appeared, pulsing softly, waiting for their answer:  

**ERASE? Y/N**  

Avery let out a broken sob, their hand hovering closer. “I don’t want this anymore.”  

The walls around them shuddered, cracks widening as the light pulsed brighter. The lab seemed to respond to Avery’s despair, the edges of the room warping, distorting.  

“You built this,” a voice said softly.  

Avery froze, their head snapping toward the far corner of the room.  

The doppelgänger stood there, bathed in the fractured light. It was almost fully formed now, every detail of Avery’s face perfectly mirrored except for those black, hollow eyes that reflected nothing.  

“You created the machine,” it continued, its voice layered with static. “You built it to erase yourself.”  

“I didn’t mean to,” Avery choked out. “I thought it would help. I thought it would—”  

“Fix you?” the figure interrupted, stepping closer. “Erase the pain? The guilt?”  

Avery’s shoulders sagged, the weight of the truth pressing down on them like a stone. “I didn’t know what I was doing.”  

The doppelgänger’s expression softened—almost pitying, almost human. “But you did, Avery. You knew it wouldn’t fix anything. You were only running from yourself. And now…”  

It gestured toward the machine, its hum rising in pitch, filling the room. “…you’ve reached the end.”  

The end.  

Avery looked back at the console, tears streaming down their face. The screen’s glow pulsed in time with their heartbeat.  

“Erase,” Avery whispered, the word almost inaudible.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head. “Is that what you want?”  

Avery stared at the console, their vision blurred with tears. “I don’t know anymore.”  

Silence hung between them, thick and suffocating.  

And then the doppelgänger spoke again, its voice soft and gentle. “You can’t erase yourself, Avery. You’re still here, no matter how much you try to disappear.”  

The words struck something deep inside Avery, a raw nerve they’d been trying to bury. They turned to face the figure, their voice barely a whisper. “Then what do I do?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, a sad, knowing smile. “You remember.”  

The hum of the machine grew deafening, shaking the room, the cracks spreading until the light threatened to consume everything. Avery staggered back, clutching their head as images—*memories*—flooded their mind in a torrent.  

Lena’s laughter.  
The accident.  
The lab, the warnings ignored.  
The device humming to life for the first time.  
The child in the hallway.  
The shadows.  
The void.  

It all came together, each fragment snapping into place like pieces of a puzzle. Avery fell to their knees, gasping for breath as the weight of it all hit them.  

“I remember,” they sobbed. “I remember everything.”  

The doppelgänger knelt in front of them, its black eyes calm, steady. “Then you know what you have to do.”  

Avery looked up, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the light flooding through the cracks. “What happens if I let go?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly. “You’ll find out.”  

The room shuddered violently, the machine’s hum rising into a roar as the console screen flickered, its message flashing one final time:  

**ERASE? Y/N**  

Avery took a deep, shuddering breath. Their hand trembled as they reached for the console, their fingers brushing the keys.  

“I won’t disappear,” they whispered, the words more for themselves than for the machine.  

They pressed the button.  

The hum reached a deafening peak, the light consuming everything. Avery closed their eyes, letting it wash over them, through them, until there was nothing left but silence—  

And the faintest whisper of a voice.  

*“You’re still here.”*  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying in a field bathed in golden light. The air was warm, the scent of wildflowers drifting on a gentle breeze.  

Slowly, they pushed themselves upright, blinking at the impossible beauty of the world around them.  

It was the field.  

The same field.  

But something was different this time. The edges of the world were clear, sharp. The warmth on their skin felt real. The hum of the machine was gone.  

A figure stood at the edge of the field, watching them.  

It was Avery.  

Not the doppelgänger. Not the shadow. Just *them*—whole and unbroken, their dark eyes reflecting the sunlight.  

“Who are you?” Avery whispered, their voice steady, clear.  

The figure smiled gently. “You already know.”  

The wind carried the words across the field, and for the first time, Avery didn’t flinch. They stood, brushing the dirt from their hands, and turned toward the horizon where the sun hung low and golden.  

And they began to walk forward.  

This time, they weren’t afraid.
