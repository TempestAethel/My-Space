## **Chapter 22: The Ultimate Betrayal (Part 1)**  

The golden field stretched endlessly, the horizon bathed in light that seemed to pulse gently with each step Avery took. The warm breeze brushed against their skin, carrying the faint scent of wildflowers. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, the hum of the machine was gone—no static, no fractures, no shadows clawing at the edges of their vision.  

And yet, Avery couldn’t shake the unease coiling deep in their chest.  

Elise walked beside them, her expression calm but her eyes darting toward Avery every so often, as if she were measuring their state of mind. Behind them, Marcus trailed a few steps back, his silence heavy and brooding. Avery could feel the weight of his gaze pressing into their back, but he said nothing.  

“You did it,” Elise said finally, breaking the quiet. Her voice was soft, tentative. “You stopped the device. The signal… it’s gone.”  

Avery didn’t answer right away. Their eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of the cracks, the glitches, the shadows that had haunted them for so long. But there was nothing—only the endless field and the clear, unwavering sky.  

“It doesn’t feel over,” Avery murmured, their voice distant.  

Elise hesitated, her brows furrowing. “What do you mean? The loop is broken. You saw it yourself—the signal collapsed when you made your choice.”  

Avery stopped walking, their hands clenching into fists at their sides. “Then why does it still feel like I’m trapped?”  

Elise turned to face them fully, her expression flickering between concern and something Avery couldn’t quite place. “You’re not trapped,” she said firmly. “This is real, Avery. You’re free.”  

Behind them, Marcus let out a sharp breath, his voice cutting through the fragile quiet. “Are they?”  

Elise shot him a warning look. “Don’t start, Marcus.”  

He ignored her, stepping forward until he was standing a few feet away from Avery. His arms were crossed over his chest, his jaw tight with barely contained frustration. “You think this is freedom?” he said, his tone low but sharp. “You think this—” he gestured to the field, to the horizon “—is real?”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, their pulse quickening. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus’s dark eyes locked onto Avery’s, unflinching. “You didn’t stop the device,” he said bluntly. “You didn’t destroy it. You just rewrote the loop. A prettier version, maybe, but it’s still a loop. You’re still trapped.”  

“That’s not true,” Elise snapped, her voice rising. She stepped between Avery and Marcus, her posture defensive. “You’re lying. The signal collapsed—Avery broke the loop!”  

“Did they?” Marcus countered, his voice steady but laced with something dangerous. “Or did they just reset it?”  

Avery’s mind raced, the doubt creeping back in like a shadow. “I… I chose to stop it,” they said, their voice trembling. “I shut it down.”  

Marcus’s gaze softened slightly, but there was no relief in his expression. “Did you?” he asked quietly. “Or did the device give you exactly what it wanted you to see?”  

Elise whirled around to face Avery, her hands gripping their shoulders. “Don’t listen to him,” she said urgently. “He’s trying to manipulate you. He’s always been against you, Avery—don’t you see that?”  

Avery stared at her, their breath catching. “What are you talking about?”  

“Elise,” Marcus warned, his tone low. “Don’t.”  

But Elise ignored him, her grip on Avery tightening. “He’s been working with the Corporation from the start,” she said, her voice trembling with barely suppressed anger. “He didn’t come back to help you—he came back to make sure the device stayed under their control.”  

“That’s a lie,” Marcus snapped, his calm demeanor cracking. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”  

“I know enough,” Elise shot back, her eyes blazing. “I know you’ve been feeding them information, sabotaging every chance Avery had to fix this.”  

Avery’s head spun, the world tilting beneath their feet. “Is that true?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he didn’t answer.  

“That’s not the point,” he said finally, his voice low.  

“It *is* the point!” Elise shouted, stepping closer to him, her body trembling with rage. “You’ve been lying to us this entire time—using Avery to clean up your mess!”  

Avery staggered back, their mind reeling. “Why?” they demanded, their voice rising. “Why would you do this?”  

Marcus exhaled sharply, his gaze shifting to the ground. “Because the device can’t be destroyed,” he said quietly. “Not completely. The Corporation knows that. They’ve known it from the start.”  

Elise froze, her eyes widening. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus looked up, his expression grim. “The signal isn’t just some anomaly, some glitch. It’s alive. It’s adaptive. Every time you try to destroy it, it learns. It rebuilds itself. The only way to contain it is to keep it under control—to trap it in a loop it can’t escape.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, the weight of his words suffocating. “And that’s what you’ve been doing?”  

Marcus nodded slowly. “I didn’t have a choice. If the Corporation got their hands on it, they’d use it to rewrite everything—memories, identities, entire lives. I couldn’t let that happen.”  

“So you used me,” Avery said, their voice trembling with anger. “You used me to fix your mistakes.”  

Marcus’s face hardened. “I was trying to protect you.”  

“By lying to me?” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “By keeping me trapped in this—this *prison*?”  

“I kept you alive!” Marcus snapped, his voice rising for the first time. “You think breaking the loop would’ve saved you? It would’ve torn you apart! The signal would’ve consumed you, erased everything that makes you *you*.”  

Avery staggered back, their body trembling. They turned to Elise, their eyes pleading. “Is that true?”  

Elise hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line.  

“It doesn’t matter,” she said finally, her voice quiet but firm. “What matters is that you have a choice now, Avery. You don’t have to stay in the loop. You can take control. Rewrite it on your terms.”  

“And what happens if I do?” Avery asked, their voice raw.  

Elise glanced at Marcus, her expression hardening. “You’ll finally be free.”  

Marcus scoffed, shaking his head. “Free to do what?” he muttered. “To destroy everything we’ve worked for? To unleash the signal again? You’re asking them to gamble with their life—and everyone else’s—for some illusion of freedom.”  

“It’s not an illusion,” Elise shot back, her voice sharp. “It’s hope.”  

The field trembled faintly, the light on the horizon dimming as the tension between them grew. The shadows at the edges of the world began to stir, creeping closer.  

Avery stood frozen between them, their mind racing, their heart pounding.  

One of them was lying.  

The other was telling the truth.  

But which one?

The silence that followed was deafening. Avery’s breath came in sharp gasps, their chest tight as the weight of the decision pressed down on them. The golden light of the field dimmed further, the edges of the world fraying, cracks spiderwebbing into the horizon.  

Avery turned to Elise, then to Marcus, their heart pounding as they searched for answers in their faces. Both looked back at them with unwavering intensity—two opposing forces, each claiming to hold the truth.  

“How am I supposed to trust either of you?” Avery asked, their voice trembling. “You’ve both lied to me.”  

“I haven’t lied,” Marcus said sharply, stepping forward. “I’ve done what I had to do. You might not like it, but I’ve always told you the truth when it mattered.”  

Elise scoffed, her eyes narrowing. “That’s rich, coming from the man who’s been working with the Corporation this whole time.”  

“I was *fighting* them,” Marcus shot back, his voice rising. “I sabotaged their plans at every turn! You think this was easy? That I wanted to use Avery? I didn’t have a choice!”  

“You always have a choice,” Elise said coldly.  

Avery’s head snapped toward her. “And what about you?” they demanded, their voice breaking. “You’ve been pushing me to take control, to ‘rewrite the loop.’ But you never told me what that actually means. What aren’t you telling me, Elise?”  

Elise hesitated, her mouth opening and closing as she struggled for an answer.  

“Elise,” Avery pressed, their tone sharper now. “Tell me the truth.”  

Elise sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Rewriting the loop means merging with the signal,” she admitted quietly. “It’s the only way to contain it, to stop it from spreading. You’d have control, Avery—but it would change you. Permanently.”  

Marcus let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “There it is,” he said. “She wasn’t going to tell you that part, was she?”  

“I was going to tell them when they were ready!” Elise snapped, her voice trembling with frustration. “It’s not an easy choice to make, Marcus. I didn’t want to force them into it!”  

“But you *were* going to force them,” Marcus said, his tone accusing. “You just wanted them to trust you first.”  

Elise glared at him, but she didn’t deny it.  

Avery stepped back, their hands shaking. “So those are my choices?” they said, their voice hollow. “Destroy the device and risk losing everything, or merge with the signal and lose myself?”  

Elise’s expression softened, and she reached out toward Avery, though she stopped short of touching them. “You wouldn’t lose yourself,” she said gently. “You’d still be you—just… more. You’d have control over the signal. You could fix the fractures, stop the loop from ever starting again.”  

Marcus shook his head, his eyes dark. “Don’t listen to her. The signal doesn’t work like that. It’s not something you can control—it’s alive, Avery. It’ll consume you, twist you into something unrecognizable. You’ll think you’re in control, but you won’t be. You’ll just be another piece of it.”  

Elise turned on him, fury blazing in her eyes. “You don’t know that!” she shouted. “You don’t know what Avery is capable of—what they can do! You’re just afraid, Marcus. Afraid that they might succeed where you failed.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he said nothing. Then he turned to Avery, his voice quieter but no less firm. “I’m not afraid for me,” he said. “I’m afraid for you. I’ve seen what the signal does to people—what it’s already done to you. If you merge with it, there won’t be anything left of who you are. You’ll disappear, Avery. Just like the others.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, their mind spinning. “The others?”  

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Elise, then back at Avery. “You’re not the first, Avery,” he said grimly. “The Corporation ran experiments—tested the device on people before you. They all tried to merge with the signal, to control it. And every single one of them failed.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, a cold knot forming in their chest. “Why didn’t you tell me this before?”  

“Because I thought you could be different,” Marcus said, his voice tinged with regret. “But now I’m not so sure.”  

Avery turned to Elise, their eyes wide with desperation. “Is that true?” they asked, their voice barely above a whisper. “Did they all fail?”  

Elise hesitated, her gaze dropping to the ground. “Yes,” she admitted quietly. “But they didn’t have what you have, Avery. They weren’t connected to the signal like you are. They weren’t its creator.”  

“That doesn’t mean it’ll work,” Marcus snapped.  

“It means Avery has a chance,” Elise shot back.  

The cracks in the field widened, light spilling through as the world trembled around them. The shadows at the edges of the horizon crept closer, their movements slow but deliberate, like predators closing in on their prey.  

Avery looked between Marcus and Elise, their heart pounding in their chest. Both of them believed they were right. Both of them wanted Avery to trust them.  

But only one of them could be telling the whole truth.  

“Why do I feel like this is still the loop?” Avery asked suddenly, their voice rising. “Why does it still feel like I’m trapped?”  

Marcus stepped forward, his expression grim. “Because you are,” he said. “As long as the device exists, the loop will keep pulling you back. Destroy it, Avery. It’s the only way to break free.”  

Elise shook her head, her eyes pleading. “You can end the loop without destroying yourself,” she said. “You can rewrite it, reshape it into something better. But you have to trust yourself, Avery. You have to believe that you’re strong enough to handle this.”  

The cracks spread further, the ground beneath Avery’s feet shaking violently. The shadows surged forward, their forms twisting and writhing, and the light from the horizon began to flicker.  

Avery’s hands clenched into fists at their sides, their mind racing. They couldn’t trust Marcus. They couldn’t trust Elise.  

But they had to make a choice.  

“I…” Avery’s voice cracked, their body trembling.  

The device’s hum grew louder, resonating in their chest, urging them forward. The shadows crept closer, their tendrils reaching for Avery, pulling them toward the edge.  

“I can’t…” Avery whispered, tears streaming down their face.  

“Choose,” the doppelgänger’s voice echoed from somewhere in the shadows. “It’s the only way out.”  

Avery closed their eyes, their heart pounding.  

And then they made their decision.
