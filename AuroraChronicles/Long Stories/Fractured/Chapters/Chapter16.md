## **Chapter 16: Erasing the Self (Part 1)**  

The darkness stretched infinitely, vast and unbroken. Avery stood alone, suspended in a void where there was no up, no down—no sense of direction at all.  

A distant hum, faint at first, began to grow louder. It wasn’t the lab this time—it wasn’t the device. It was something deeper, vibrating in Avery’s bones like a memory they couldn’t shake.  

A voice whispered softly from nowhere and everywhere at once.  

*“You’re almost there.”*  

Avery turned sharply, their heart pounding in their chest. “Who’s there?”  

The void rippled, a faint shimmer breaking the darkness in front of them. Slowly, shapes began to form—a table, a chair, the faint outline of walls and screens glowing faintly. The emptiness receded, and Avery realized they were no longer floating.  

They were back in the lab.  

The lab… but not quite.  

The edges of the room flickered and glitched, the floor stretching and distorting like a broken image on a corrupted screen. The device sat on the table, but its shape pulsed, shifting ever so slightly—as though it couldn’t decide what it was supposed to be.  

*“Welcome back, Avery.”*  

The voice came from behind them, calm and unnervingly familiar.  

Avery turned slowly, dread pooling in their stomach. Standing across the room was the doppelgänger—the other Avery. The reflection of themselves smiled faintly, its black, featureless eyes glinting in the flickering light.  

“Not you again,” Avery whispered, their voice shaking.  

“Me again,” the doppelgänger replied, stepping closer. “But you don’t need to fight me anymore. This time, I’m here to help.”  

Avery laughed bitterly, though it was more of a strangled sound than anything else. “Help? You call this helping? You’ve been tormenting me!”  

The doppelgänger’s smile didn’t waver. “You still don’t understand, do you?”  

“Understand what?” Avery shot back, their anger boiling over. “What the hell is happening to me? Why does everything feel… wrong?”  

The other Avery tilted its head, its expression almost sympathetic. “Because you’re not supposed to exist.”  

Avery froze, the words slicing through them like ice. “What?”  

The doppelgänger spread its arms, gesturing to the flickering lab, to the distorted walls and the pulsing device. “None of this is real, Avery. Not the lab. Not the device. Not even you.”  

Avery took a step back, their head shaking instinctively. “No. That’s not true.”  

“It is,” the reflection said softly. “You’re a fragment. A copy. A piece of a mind that was already broken.”  

“No!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I remember! I remember everything. My work. Elise. Marcus. The device. I—”  

“Do you?” the doppelgänger interrupted. “Do you really?”  

The hum grew louder, vibrating through the walls as the room began to ripple again. Avery clutched their head, the pressure building behind their eyes. Images flashed across their mind in rapid succession—fractured, chaotic, impossible to hold onto.  

The lab.  

The house.  

The child’s voice.  

The faceless figure reaching through the door.  

A memory—sharp and sudden—pushed its way to the surface. Avery gasped as it hit them like a physical blow.  

---

*The device was never supposed to be used like this.*  

They had been in the lab, Elise at their side, the Corporation’s representatives watching silently from the shadows. The device hummed softly, its presence as cold and foreboding as ever. Avery remembered Marcus standing in the corner, his arms crossed, his face a mask of quiet dread.  

“What happens if it glitches?” Elise had asked, her voice steady but tinged with concern.  

Avery had looked at her, their hands poised over the console. “It won’t glitch.”  

“But what if it does?” Elise had pressed.  

Avery hadn’t answered. Instead, they had activated the device.  

For a brief moment, everything had been perfect. The memory wiped clean. The subject at peace. But then… something had gone wrong.  

The readings had spiked, the machine groaning under the strain as something *else* bled through.  

The anomaly.  

The signal.  

The thing they didn’t understand and couldn’t control.  

Avery remembered Elise shouting, Marcus pulling them away from the console as the device screamed with a sound that wasn’t mechanical at all.  

And then—  

---

Avery’s vision snapped back to the flickering lab, their breath ragged. “No,” they whispered, their voice hoarse. “I didn’t…”  

“You did,” the doppelgänger said softly. “You broke it. And when you did, it broke you.”  

Avery stumbled back, their mind spinning. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”  

The reflection stepped closer, its black eyes glinting. “You’re a memory, Avery. A fragment of something that’s already gone. That’s why nothing makes sense. That’s why you can’t escape.”  

“No,” Avery sobbed, collapsing to their knees. “I’m real. I have to be real.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t want to exist, Avery. Not like this. Not as a shadow of someone who’s already gone.”  

Avery looked up, tears streaming down their face. “What… what do you mean?”  

The reflection reached out, placing a hand gently on Avery’s shoulder. “You’re the glitch. The error in the system. The only way to fix it is to let go.”  

“Let go?” Avery repeated, their voice trembling.  

The lab flickered violently now, the hum rising to a deafening roar. The walls warped and twisted, the device pulsing with an unnatural light. Avery felt it—the world unraveling around them, pulling them down into the void.  

“Let go, Avery,” the doppelgänger whispered. “It’s the only way.”  

The ground cracked beneath them, darkness seeping through. Avery stared into it, their mind a whirlwind of fear and confusion.  

*Let go.*  

The doppelgänger smiled, its black eyes softening. “It’s time to stop fighting.”  

The hum reached its peak, the lab collapsing into shadow. Avery felt themselves falling—weightless, untethered—as the darkness swallowed them whole.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying on the floor of the lab. The device was still there, humming softly, its glow faint and pulsing. The console screen flickered with a single message:  

**Erase?**  

Avery stared at the words, their hands trembling as they reached for the console.  

“Yes,” they whispered.  

The screen blinked once, then twice, before the hum of the device began to rise. Avery closed their eyes, tears slipping down their cheeks as the world around them started to fade.  

For the first time in what felt like forever, Avery let go.

## **Chapter 16: Erasing the Self (Part 2)**  

The hum of the device grew louder, vibrating through the walls, through Avery’s bones, through the very fabric of their mind. The console screen flashed its single command:  

**Erase?**  

Avery’s trembling hand hovered over the button, sweat dripping from their temple as they stared at it. The word blinked rhythmically, an impossible decision pulsing in time with their heartbeat.  

“Yes,” Avery whispered again, their voice breaking.  

But the moment their fingers brushed the screen, the hum *shifted*. It wasn’t a hum anymore—it was a voice.  

*“Avery…”*  

Avery’s head snapped up, their hand jerking away as if burned. The screen distorted, the text glitching and breaking into unreadable symbols before settling again.  

**Do you remember?**  

Avery staggered back, their chest heaving. “What… what is this?”  

The room darkened, the glow from the device pulsing brighter, casting long shadows across the lab. Avery’s ears buzzed with static, and then the voice came again—soft and faint at first, like a whisper on the edge of hearing.  

*“You don’t have to do this.”*  

Avery spun around, searching the room. “Who’s there?”  

The lab flickered—just for a moment—and Avery saw something impossible. The walls rippled like water, the floor beneath them cracking open to reveal glimpses of something deeper. Shapes twisted in the shadows—figures, fragments of memory—and then they were gone, leaving Avery gasping.  

The screen flickered again:  

**You are not alone.**  

The words froze Avery in place, a chill creeping through their veins.  

“I don’t understand,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “What are you? What is all of this?”  

The device pulsed violently, the sound building into a crescendo before breaking into something new—something *human*. The whispers overlapped, a chorus of voices—each one familiar, each one speaking words that Avery couldn’t quite grasp.  

And then, from the shadows, a figure stepped forward.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat.  

It was Elise.  

Her face was pale, her dark eyes hollow, but it was *her*. She stood across the room, her movements unnaturally smooth, as though the air itself carried her forward.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice cracked. “Is that really you?”  

Elise’s head tilted slightly, her expression unreadable. “Why are you doing this, Avery?”  

“I’m trying to stop it,” Avery choked out. “The device—it’s breaking everything. I have to—”  

“Erase yourself?” Elise interrupted, her voice soft but sharp. “Do you think that’s going to fix anything?”  

Avery flinched, her words striking like a slap. “I don’t know what else to do.”  

Elise stepped closer, her form flickering like a broken projection. “This isn’t the way. You’re running from something you don’t want to face.”  

“I’m *not* running!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You don’t understand what it’s like. I opened the door. I let it out. It’s inside me, Elise. It’s tearing me apart.”  

Elise’s face softened, and for the briefest moment, she looked like herself again—*really* herself. “You didn’t let it out,” she said quietly. “You let it in.”  

Avery froze, her words echoing in their mind. “What?”  

Elise took another step forward, her form glitching as though reality itself struggled to hold her together. “The signal. The fractures. They’re not outside you, Avery. They’re *you*. Pieces of yourself—broken, buried, denied.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, backing away. “No, that’s not true.”  

“It is,” Elise said softly, her voice layered now—Marcus’s voice joining hers, then the child’s, then the doppelgänger’s. “You’re not erasing the device. You’re erasing yourself.”  

The room trembled violently, the walls stretching and distorting. The device’s hum swelled, the static-laden voices growing louder, drowning out everything else.  

Avery clutched their head, falling to their knees. “Stop! Please, make it stop!”  

The shadows swirled around them, the figures and fragments bleeding together. The child’s laughter. Marcus’s warnings. Elise’s voice. The faceless figure’s silent scream.  

And through it all, the device’s glow pulsed brighter and brighter.  

*“You already know.”*  

Avery opened their eyes, tears streaming down their face, as the screen blinked one final time:  

**Erase? Y/N**  

The lab faded around them. The whispers stilled. The device went silent, waiting for Avery’s answer.  

For a long moment, they just stared.  

And then, slowly, Avery reached out.  

Their hand hovered over the console, shaking.  

“What do I do?” they whispered.  

The faintest voice—soft and calm—whispered back from the void.  

*“Remember.”*  

Avery’s hand faltered, their chest tightening.  

“Remember what?” they whispered.  

The screen flashed again, and Avery saw the words—words they hadn’t seen before, words that shattered the silence.  

**You are still here.**  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat.  

The device pulsed one final time, and the darkness around them shattered like glass, fragments of light and shadow cascading into nothingness. Avery screamed as they fell through the void, their mind splintering into pieces.  

And then—  

Light.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying on their back, staring up at a clear blue sky. The air was still, the world quiet.  

They sat up slowly, their body aching, their head pounding.  

They were in a field.  

The same field.  

Golden light spilled across the grass, and a soft breeze whispered through the wildflowers. Avery stared, their mind reeling. It felt… real.  

It felt *whole*.  

A voice called to them, distant and familiar.  

“Avery!”  

They turned toward the sound, their chest tightening.  

A figure stood at the edge of the field, silhouetted by the sun. They couldn’t see their face, but Avery knew who it was.  

It was themselves.  

The figure lifted a hand, waving gently. “It’s time to wake up.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened, their hands clenching the grass beneath them. “Where am I?” they whispered.  

The figure smiled faintly, their voice soft as they replied.  

“You already know.”  

The light grew brighter, swallowing everything. Avery closed their eyes as the warmth enveloped them, and for the first time in what felt like forever—  

They let go.
