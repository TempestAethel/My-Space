## **Chapter 2: Fractured Perception (Part 1)**  

Avery stared at the blank wall of their apartment, the hum of the city beyond the windows a distant, muffled noise. It had been 36 hours since the failed experiment, and yet their mind refused to quiet down. Sleep had eluded them completely, chased off by the replaying echoes of that voice: *You already know.*  

The words scratched at the edges of their thoughts like an itch they couldn’t reach. Who—or what—had spoken them? And why had the device reacted the way it did? No matter how many scenarios Avery ran through their head, they all led back to the same unnerving conclusion: something was wrong with the MERI Device, something they hadn’t accounted for.  

The thought terrified them.  

A sharp knock at the door jolted Avery out of their spiraling thoughts. For a moment, they didn’t move, caught between the instinct to answer and the creeping paranoia that had taken root since the experiment. The knock came again, louder this time.  

“It’s me,” Elise’s voice called from the other side.  

Avery let out a shaky breath and moved to unlock the door. Elise stepped inside, carrying a paper bag in one hand and a tablet tucked under her arm. She looked as exhausted as Avery felt, her usually sharp appearance dulled by fatigue.  

“I brought food,” she said, setting the bag on the counter without waiting for a response. “Figured you haven’t eaten.”  

Avery didn’t deny it. They hadn’t thought about food in hours—maybe longer. “Thanks,” they muttered, though they made no move toward the bag.  

Elise leaned against the counter, studying Avery carefully. “You’re not doing yourself any favors by shutting yourself in here. You need rest, Avery. Clear your head.”  

“I can’t,” Avery replied, running a hand through their already disheveled hair. “Not until I figure out what happened. The data doesn’t make sense, Elise. That signal—whatever it was—it wasn’t just noise. It was deliberate.”  

Elise sighed, rubbing her temples. “We don’t know that for sure. It could’ve been an artifact, a glitch in the system. Neural interfaces are incredibly sensitive—”  

“No,” Avery interrupted, their voice firmer than they intended. “That wasn’t a glitch. It was… something else. I felt it, Elise. It wasn’t just inside the device—it was inside me.”  

The admission hung heavy in the air. Elise’s expression hardened, her professional detachment slipping for just a moment to reveal a flicker of unease.  

“Do you hear yourself right now?” she said, her tone sharp. “You’re letting your imagination run wild. Neural feedback can cause strange sensations—visions, voices, even feelings of detachment. It’s all explainable.”  

“Then explain the voice,” Avery shot back. “Explain why I heard my own voice saying something I never said. Explain why it answered me.”  

Elise hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. “We don’t have all the answers yet. That’s why we need to approach this rationally. If we start chasing shadows, we’ll lose sight of what’s actually important: fixing the device and making sure this doesn’t happen again.”  

Avery shook their head, frustration bubbling beneath their exhaustion. “You don’t understand. This isn’t just about the device—it’s about what it’s doing to me. To us.”  

Elise opened her mouth to argue but stopped short when her tablet beeped, breaking the tension. She pulled it out, frowning at the screen.  

“What is it?” Avery asked, their pulse quickening.  

“Security flagged an anomaly at the lab,” Elise replied, her voice suddenly tight. “The system logged unauthorized access to the MERI Device’s core files.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted. “When?”  

“An hour ago.” Elise’s eyes met theirs, the tension in her expression mirroring Avery’s growing unease. “Someone’s been tampering with it.”  

Without another word, they grabbed their coats and rushed out the door.

The lab felt different at night. The familiar hum of the equipment was more pronounced in the absence of daylight, and the shadows cast by the overhead lights seemed deeper, more menacing. Avery felt the weight of the space pressing down on them as they stepped inside, Elise close behind.  

The console where the MERI Device sat was illuminated, the screen glowing faintly in the dim light. Avery’s breath caught in their throat as they approached it, the back of their neck prickling with an instinctual sense of wrongness.  

“Who could’ve accessed it?” Avery whispered, their voice barely audible.  

“No one should have clearance but us,” Elise replied, though her tone carried more doubt than certainty.  

The console’s screen displayed a stream of code—unfamiliar, jagged lines that seemed to pulse faintly, almost as if alive. Avery’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitation creeping into their movements.  

“It’s the same signal,” they murmured, their heart pounding.  

Elise leaned closer, her eyes narrowing as she studied the screen. “It’s more than a signal. Look at the patterns. It’s replicating itself.”  

Avery’s breath hitched. “That’s impossible. The device isn’t programmed to—”  

“It doesn’t matter what it’s programmed to do,” Elise interrupted, her voice sharp. “Something is rewriting the core functions.”  

A sudden chill settled over the room, and Avery felt a growing sense of dread. It wasn’t just the patterns on the screen—it was the sensation that had been gnawing at them since the experiment. The feeling that they weren’t alone.  

“I’m going to isolate the anomaly,” Elise said, pulling out a portable drive from her pocket. “If we can extract the corrupted data, we might be able to figure out where it’s coming from.”  

Avery nodded, though their focus remained fixed on the screen. The patterns seemed to shift as they watched, the jagged lines twisting into shapes that almost resembled—  

Words.  

Avery blinked, their mind reeling as they tried to make sense of what they were seeing. It was faint, but unmistakable. The patterns had formed letters, then words, scrawled across the console like a digital ghost.  

*I SEE YOU.*  

“Avery,” Elise’s voice broke through their stupor, but they barely registered it. Their chest tightened, and their pulse thundered in their ears.  

The lights in the lab flickered. Once. Twice. Then they went out, plunging the room into darkness.

## **Chapter 2: Fractured Perception (Part 2)**  

The darkness swallowed everything. For a moment, Avery could only hear their own ragged breathing, quick and shallow, echoing in the oppressive silence of the lab. The faint hum of the equipment was gone, as if the building itself had been plunged into some void where sound couldn’t escape.  

“Elise?” Avery called, their voice trembling.  

“I’m here,” Elise replied from somewhere nearby. Her tone was sharp, controlled, but Avery could hear the undercurrent of tension. A metallic click followed as Elise activated her handheld flashlight, the beam cutting through the blackness.  

The narrow cone of light illuminated fragments of the room: the edge of the console, the cold steel of the MERI Device, the faint outline of wires snaking across the floor. It was enough to ground Avery for a moment, though the lingering sense of dread didn’t fade.  

“What the hell just happened?” Avery asked, moving closer to Elise.  

“I don’t know,” Elise admitted, scanning the room with the flashlight. “The power shouldn’t have cut like that. There’s backup generators for the whole lab.”  

The light flickered slightly, and Avery caught a glimpse of her face—pale, tense, her lips pressed into a grim line.  

“Could it be the anomaly?” Avery asked, their voice barely above a whisper.  

Elise hesitated, her jaw tightening. “If the anomaly’s corrupted the device’s systems, it might be affecting the rest of the lab’s infrastructure. But that still doesn’t explain—”  

She froze mid-sentence, the flashlight beam halting on the console. The screen had come back to life, faintly glowing in the darkness.  

“Elise…?” Avery stepped forward, their pulse quickening.  

The screen shouldn’t have been operational. Without power, the console should’ve been as dead as the rest of the equipment. And yet, faint lines of code were scrolling across its surface, the same jagged patterns Avery had seen earlier.  

“It’s still active,” Elise murmured, moving closer.  

“No. It’s… something else,” Avery said. The glow of the screen seemed unnatural, almost organic in its pulsations.  

Before either of them could move, the text on the screen shifted, the fragmented code rearranging itself into coherent words.  

*HELLO, AVERY.*  

Avery’s heart slammed against their ribs. “This isn’t possible,” they whispered.  

“It’s responding to you,” Elise said, her voice tight.  

“No—it’s not responding. It’s initiating,” Avery corrected. Their mind raced, trying to process what they were seeing. The MERI Device wasn’t designed to communicate, let alone generate messages.  

The words on the screen began to shift again, the letters rearranging themselves into another sentence:  

*DO YOU REMEMBER?*  

Avery took a step back, the weight of the question pressing down on them. The words felt personal, deliberate, as if the machine—or whatever was controlling it—was reaching into their mind.  

“I’m shutting this down,” Elise said, her movements quick and precise. She plugged the portable drive into the console, her fingers flying over the keyboard in an attempt to isolate the anomaly.  

The screen flickered violently, the words dissolving into chaos. For a moment, the entire lab seemed to vibrate, a low, guttural hum resonating through the walls.  

“Elise, stop—” Avery started, but the hum abruptly ceased, plunging the room into a suffocating silence once more.  

Elise turned to Avery, her face shadowed and unreadable in the dim light. “The data’s been transferred. Whatever this… thing is, we can analyze it outside the lab.”  

Avery nodded, though unease twisted in their gut. They didn’t trust the idea of taking the anomaly anywhere—it already felt like it had a will of its own, and the thought of it escaping the confines of the lab was almost too much to bear.  

As Elise removed the portable drive, the screen lit up one final time. A single sentence appeared, burning itself into Avery’s memory:  

*YOU CAN’T ERASE THE TRUTH.*  

---

The car ride back to Elise’s apartment was silent. The city outside the windows was as alive as ever, neon lights reflecting off rain-slicked streets, but it all felt distant and hollow. Avery stared out at the blur of colors, their mind stuck on the words.  

*Do you remember? You can’t erase the truth.*  

The questions they had been asking themselves since the experiment seemed to multiply, growing louder and more insistent. What truth? What was the device trying to tell them?  

“You’re too quiet,” Elise said, breaking the silence.  

Avery blinked, glancing at her. “What do you want me to say?”  

“I don’t know. Maybe that you’re not going to spiral into another breakdown,” Elise replied, her tone sharper than usual.  

Avery frowned, irritation bubbling beneath their exhaustion. “I’m not spiraling, Elise. I’m trying to make sense of what’s happening—something you seem determined to write off as just ‘glitches.’”  

“It *is* a glitch,” Elise snapped, her knuckles white against the steering wheel. “Or an anomaly, or whatever you want to call it. But the more you treat this like it’s some kind of sentient ghost, the more you’re going to lose focus on what matters.”  

“And what matters?” Avery shot back. “Fixing the device so the Corporation can turn it into a weapon? Erasing memories to make people more ‘manageable’? That’s what you want me to focus on?”  

Elise didn’t respond immediately. Her jaw tightened, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. “That’s not fair,” she said finally, her voice quieter.  

“Isn’t it?” Avery muttered, turning back to the window.  

The rest of the drive passed in strained silence.  

---

Elise’s apartment was a stark contrast to Avery’s cluttered, sterile workspace. Warm lighting spilled across minimalist furniture, the faint scent of coffee lingering in the air. It should have been comforting, but Avery felt out of place, like an intruder in someone else’s life.  

Elise set the portable drive on the coffee table and sank into the armchair opposite Avery. “We’ll start analyzing the data tomorrow,” she said, her tone clipped. “But for now, we need to get some rest.”  

Avery opened their mouth to protest but stopped when they caught the look on Elise’s face. Beneath her sharp exterior, she looked exhausted, worn down by the weight of everything that had happened.  

“Fine,” Avery muttered. “But tomorrow, I want answers.”  

Elise nodded, rising to her feet. “Tomorrow,” she agreed before disappearing into her room.  

Left alone, Avery leaned back on the couch, staring up at the ceiling. The words from the lab echoed in their mind, refusing to fade.  

*Do you remember? You can’t erase the truth.*  

Avery closed their eyes, hoping for sleep. Instead, they found memories waiting for them—fractured, fleeting images that didn’t fit together.  

A child’s laughter. The crack of glass breaking. A faceless figure, always just out of reach.  

And somewhere, just beneath the surface, a voice whispered:  

*You already know.*
