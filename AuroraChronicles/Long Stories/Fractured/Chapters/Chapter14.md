## **Chapter 14: Fractured Truths (Part 1)**  

Avery stared at the version of themselves standing a few feet away, their breath caught in their chest. It was uncanny—perfect in every way—except for the black, empty eyes that seemed to swallow the space around them.  

“Welcome back,” the doppelgänger said softly, the words dripping with something Avery couldn’t name. Its voice was calm, steady—*their* voice—but hearing it from the other made Avery’s skin crawl.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, fists clenching at their sides. “Where am I?”  

The other Avery tilted their head, their smile widening ever so slightly. “You already know.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, that familiar phrase echoing through their mind like a persistent echo. *You already know.*  

“I don’t!” Avery snapped, the frustration boiling over. “I don’t know anything. What is this place? Why are you here?”  

The doppelgänger took a single step forward, and the ground beneath their feet rippled like water. “This place is what remains when you strip everything else away,” they said, their tone almost gentle. “The truth, Avery. Or what’s left of it.”  

Avery took a step back instinctively, their pulse hammering in their ears. “This isn’t real. None of this is real.”  

“Isn’t it?” The doppelgänger spread their arms, motioning to the endless white void surrounding them. “You can tell yourself that, if it helps. But it won’t change what you are.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “What I am?”  

The other Avery nodded slowly. “You’re the one who let this happen. You’re the one who broke the world.”  

“Shut up!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. The words stung, hitting too close to the thoughts already clawing at the edges of their mind.  

“You built the device,” the doppelgänger continued, unfazed. “You tested it. You ignored the warnings. And now you’re stuck here, just like the rest of us.”  

Avery’s mind reeled, their vision blurring with the weight of the accusation. “No. No, I didn’t—”  

“You did,” the doppelgänger interrupted, their voice sharper now. “You did this. You’re the reason everything is breaking.”  

The ground beneath Avery trembled, as if the world itself were reacting to the truth. “I didn’t know,” Avery whispered, their voice weak. “I didn’t know this would happen.”  

The other Avery stepped closer, their black eyes locking onto Avery’s. “But you did, didn’t you?”  

Avery shook their head, tears burning at the corners of their eyes. “No!”  

“You ignored the signs.” The doppelgänger’s voice grew louder, the air around them vibrating with an unseen pressure. “You ignored Marcus. You ignored Elise. You even ignored yourself. Because you wanted to believe you were doing something good.”  

The words hit Avery like blows, each one striking deeper. They stumbled backward, their knees threatening to give out. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean for this…”  

“But it doesn’t matter what you meant.” The doppelgänger’s voice was cold now, devoid of the gentleness it held before. “This is where it ends. This is where you face what you’ve done.”  

The air grew heavy, the white void around them dimming, as though darkness were seeping in from the edges. Avery looked around wildly, their chest tight with panic.  

“What is happening?” they gasped, struggling to breathe.  

“The walls are closing in,” the doppelgänger said, their voice echoing ominously. “It’s almost over now, Avery.”  

The darkness crept closer, tendrils of shadow stretching across the ground like cracks in a pane of glass. Avery felt the pull—like something inside the void wanted to drag them under.  

“You can’t run from it anymore,” the other Avery whispered, their black eyes glinting with cruel certainty. “The truth is here.”  

The shadows reached Avery’s feet, curling around their shoes like cold, grasping fingers. Avery tried to step back, but the ground was gone—there was nowhere left to go.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed, their voice raw and desperate. “Please, stop!”  

The doppelgänger only smiled, their expression dark and knowing. “You can’t erase the truth, Avery.”  

The darkness surged forward, swallowing the space around them. Avery’s vision blurred, the doppelgänger’s face fading into the void, until all that remained was the sound of their voice.  

“You already know.”  

And then—  

Nothing.  

---  

When Avery woke, they were lying on a cold, hard surface. Their head throbbed, the ache radiating deep into their skull. For a moment, they didn’t move, too afraid to open their eyes and see what waited for them.  

The sound of distant humming—soft and mechanical—reached their ears, breaking through the haze of silence. Slowly, they opened their eyes.  

They were back in the lab.  

The console flickered softly, its glow the only light in the room. The device sat on the table where it always had, silent and polished, as though none of it—*any of it*—had ever happened.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their limbs shaking from the effort. The lab was empty. Elise was gone. Marcus was gone. The faceless figure was gone.  

It was just them.  

And the device.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “Not again.”  

They stumbled to their feet, clutching the edge of the table to steady themselves. The console screen blinked once, then twice, before a single line of text appeared.  

**Are you ready to remember?**  

Avery stared at the words, their pulse pounding in their ears.  

*No.*  

They weren’t ready.  

But they knew they didn’t have a choice.

The words on the screen—**Are you ready to remember?**—blinked slowly, as if taunting Avery with the question. Their hands trembled as they gripped the edge of the table, the weight of it pressing down like an invisible force.  

“Remember what?” Avery muttered, their voice barely above a whisper. They knew they wouldn’t get an answer. Not from the machine. Not from anyone.  

The hum of the lab equipment grew louder, vibrating deep in Avery’s chest. The screen flickered again, and new text appeared:  

**It started with you.**  

Avery’s pulse quickened, sweat pooling at the back of their neck. “No,” they said, shaking their head. “No, I didn’t… I didn’t mean for any of this.”  

The device, silent and polished, seemed to stare back at them. Memories began to push their way to the surface—shards of images and sounds—unwelcome and unstoppable. Avery squeezed their eyes shut, trying to push them back down, but it was like holding back a flood.  

*The laughter of a child.*  

*Glass shattering.*  

*The lab, glowing with monitors, Elise’s face lit up with grim determination.*  

The sound of a door opening behind them jolted Avery back to the present. They spun around, their heart in their throat.  

Elise stood there, her face pale, her eyes dark with exhaustion. She looked… wrong, somehow. Like a version of herself that didn’t quite belong.  

“Elise?” Avery said cautiously.  

Elise didn’t answer right away. She stepped forward, her movements slow and deliberate. “You’ve seen it now, haven’t you?”  

Avery’s chest tightened. “Seen what?”  

“The truth,” Elise replied, her voice soft but edged with something darker. “It’s breaking through, Avery. You can’t keep running from it.”  

“This isn’t real,” Avery said, their voice cracking. “You’re not real.”  

Elise smiled faintly, and Avery felt the ground tilt beneath them. “That’s what you told yourself, isn’t it? That none of it was real. That it wasn’t your fault.”  

The room felt smaller now, the walls closing in. Avery stumbled back, shaking their head. “Stop. You’re not Elise.”  

The lights in the lab dimmed, plunging half the room into shadow. Elise’s form seemed to blur at the edges, the darkness clinging to her like oil.  

“Do you want to know what you did?” Elise whispered, taking another step closer.  

“No!” Avery shouted, their voice ragged. “I didn’t do anything!”  

But the memories were already surfacing. They felt as though they were drowning in them, each one more vivid than the last.  

---  

*The first test had been a success—or so Avery had thought.*  

They had stood at the console, Elise and Marcus watching as the MERI Device hummed to life. The subject—a man whose face Avery couldn’t quite remember—had sat perfectly still in the chair, electrodes pressed to his temples.  

“It’s working,” Elise had said, her voice tight with awe. “Look at the readings. We’re erasing it.”  

Avery had smiled then, relief washing over them. It had been a breakthrough. Years of work, sleepless nights, and relentless failures had finally paid off. The subject’s trauma—his unbearable memories—were being wiped clean.  

But something had happened.  

The readings spiked. The man’s breathing grew shallow, his body jerking violently against the restraints.  

“Shut it down!” Marcus had shouted.  

Avery had hesitated, staring at the console as the numbers flashed red. They’d thought it was a glitch—something minor, something they could fix. But by the time they pressed the emergency shutdown, it was too late.  

The man had gone still.  

Too still.  

Avery remembered staring at his face, at his blank, unseeing eyes. Elise had been shouting something, but the words were muffled, lost beneath the deafening hum of the device.  

“What did you do, Avery?” Marcus had said, his voice shaking with anger.  

Avery had looked down at the console, at the pulsing anomaly in the data. It shouldn’t have been there. It hadn’t been there before. But it was now—growing, spreading—like something alive.  

And Avery had realized, in that moment, what they had unleashed.  

---  

The memory shattered, and Avery collapsed to their knees in the lab, gasping for breath. The hum of the device seemed louder now, vibrating through the floor, through their bones.  

“I tried to stop it,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “I didn’t know…”  

“You knew,” Elise’s voice said softly.  

Avery looked up, their vision blurred with tears. Elise stood over them, her features distorted now, as though the darkness was eating away at her edges.  

“You knew what it could become,” she continued. “And you did it anyway.”  

“No,” Avery sobbed, their hands clenching into fists. “I didn’t mean for this to happen. I didn’t—”  

The lights flickered violently, and the walls around them rippled, the lab dissolving into shadow. Avery staggered to their feet, backing away as Elise’s form began to blur and shift.  

“You can’t hide from yourself,” she said, her voice deepening, becoming layered—*inhuman*.  

The last of Elise’s features melted away, leaving behind a familiar form.  

Avery.  

The doppelgänger stood in her place now, its black eyes glinting like endless voids. It smiled faintly, its expression cold and cruel.  

“You built the device,” it said, taking a step forward. “You opened the door.”  

Avery stumbled back, shaking uncontrollably. “Stay away from me!”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its black eyes never leaving Avery’s. “You can’t run anymore. It’s time to remember.”  

The hum of the device grew deafening, the darkness pressing in from all sides. Avery felt it—pulling at them, dragging them down into the shadows.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed.  

The doppelgänger reached out, its voice a whisper that echoed in Avery’s mind.  

*“You already know.”*  

Avery’s vision went black, the world collapsing around them.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were no longer in the lab.  

They stood in a field bathed in golden light, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers. The hum of the device was gone, replaced by the distant sound of birdsong and the gentle whisper of the wind.  

For a moment, Avery didn’t move. They just stood there, staring at the impossible beauty of the world around them.  

Then, slowly, they turned.  

A small house sat at the edge of the field, its windows glowing faintly with light. Avery’s chest tightened as they stared at it, memories pushing their way to the surface.  

They knew this place.  

They had been here before.  

“Come inside,” a voice called softly.  

It was a child’s voice—familiar, distant, and impossibly clear. Avery’s hands trembled as they took a step toward the house, their heart pounding in their chest.  

The door creaked open as they approached, revealing nothing but darkness beyond.  

*“You already know,”* the voice whispered again, pulling Avery forward.  

And this time, Avery stepped inside.
