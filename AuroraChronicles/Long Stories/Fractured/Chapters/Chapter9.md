## **Chapter 9: The Descent (Part 1)**  

Darkness.  

It was absolute—thick, suffocating, pressing against Avery’s skin like a living thing. They drifted in it, weightless, untethered, their mind suspended between numbness and chaos.  

*Wake up.*  

The words echoed in the void, distant and distorted.  

*Wake up.*  

Avery tried to move, but there was no body, no ground, nothing to grasp. Only the voice—familiar, yet foreign. It wasn’t Elise’s voice. It wasn’t their reflection.  

It was *theirs*.  

*“You erased it.”*  

The memory cut through the darkness like a blade.  

A scream. Blood on their hands. A child’s laughter fading into silence.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Stop it.”  

But the memories kept coming. Shards of light breaking through the dark—violent flashes of color, sound, pain.  

The lab. The device humming to life. Elise shouting their name, her voice panicked.  

And then—  

*Nothing.*  

---

When the darkness lifted, Avery found themselves standing in a *house*.  

It was warm, lived-in—sunlight spilled through the curtains, casting soft golden rays across the wooden floor. The air smelled faintly of coffee and flowers, and somewhere in the distance, a soft breeze rattled a wind chime.  

Avery blinked, disoriented. Their body felt solid again, their feet grounded. This place was… calm. *Safe.*  

But Avery knew better.  

They turned slowly, their eyes sweeping the room. It was a living room—simple, unremarkable. A couch, a coffee table with a half-empty mug, and shelves lined with photographs.  

Avery hesitated, their pulse quickening. The photographs.  

One by one, they stepped closer, dread coiling in their stomach.  

The frames were turned inward.  

Avery reached for the nearest one, their fingers trembling. Slowly, they turned it around.  

The glass was cracked. Beneath it, a photo of *themself*. Smiling. Beside them stood a woman with dark hair and bright eyes—eyes that sparkled with warmth and love.  

Avery’s breath hitched.  

*Elise.*  

No. Not Elise. Not the Elise they knew. The woman in the photo looked softer, younger—her presence full of life. And in her arms…  

Avery’s chest tightened as their gaze fell to the child she held.  

A girl. No more than four or five. Her face was blurred, indistinct, as though the memory itself refused to let Avery see.  

The picture slipped from Avery’s hands, shattering against the floor.  

“*Who was she?*” Avery whispered, their voice breaking.  

“You know.”  

The voice made Avery spin around.  

The reflection was there again, standing in the doorway. Its posture was relaxed, its expression unreadable, but its presence seemed *heavier* now—like the air bent around it.  

Avery shook their head. “No. No, I don’t.”  

The reflection stepped forward. “Yes, you do.”  

Avery backed away until they hit the wall. “Why are you doing this? Why are you showing me this?”  

The reflection tilted its head. “I’m not showing you anything. *You’re remembering.*”  

Avery froze, their heart pounding. “No. I don’t want to. I can’t—”  

“You *have* to.”  

The words rang with finality, and as the reflection spoke, the room around them began to *shift*.  

The light dimmed. The warm colors faded to gray. The air grew heavy, and the sound of the wind chime turned into a hollow, metallic clang.  

The child’s laughter echoed faintly in the distance.  

Avery sank to their knees, clutching their head. “Stop it. Please stop.”  

The reflection stood over them now, its dark, empty eyes fixed on Avery.  

“You built the machine to escape this,” it said softly. “To erase *her*. To erase *them*. But memory doesn’t die, Avery. It festers. It *waits*.”  

A sharp pain split through Avery’s skull, and they cried out, collapsing onto the cold, shifting floor.  

Images flooded their mind again—the child’s blurred face, the swing set, *the accident*.  

Blood.  

The sound of sirens. Elise’s voice screaming their name.  

And then—  

The machine.  

*Erase it. Make it go away.*  

Avery gasped, their body wracked with sobs. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t mean to forget.”  

The reflection knelt beside them, its voice soft now. “But you did.”  

Avery lifted their tear-streaked face, staring at their double through blurry eyes. “Why are you doing this?”  

The reflection reached out, placing a cold hand on Avery’s shoulder.  

“Because it’s time to stop running.”  

The ground beneath Avery began to splinter. Cracks spiderwebbed across the surface, and the house—everything around them—started to crumble.  

“No!” Avery screamed, grabbing at the floor as it broke apart, pulling them into the void. “No, please—*I’m not ready!*”  

The reflection’s voice echoed as the darkness swallowed them whole.  

“You have to be.”

When Avery’s eyes opened, they were back in the lab.  

But something was different.  

The air was still, but it carried a weight that hadn’t been there before. The monitors around the room were dark, and the memory device sat on the table, its surface cracked, faint wisps of smoke curling from its circuits.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body trembling. The floor beneath them felt solid. Real.  

And across the room, sitting in one of the chairs, was Elise.  

Her head was bowed, her dark hair falling forward, but her voice was clear and steady.  

“You finally did it.”  

Avery blinked, disoriented. “Did… what?”  

Elise lifted her head, her eyes meeting Avery’s. They were filled with exhaustion—and something else. *Relief.*  

“You remembered.”  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. “I… I don’t understand.”  

Elise stood slowly, crossing the room until she stood in front of Avery. “You’ve been looping for so long, Avery. Trapped. Fighting yourself. All because you refused to face what happened.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their voice shaking. “The child. Who was she?”  

Elise placed a gentle hand on Avery’s shoulder. “You already know.”  

The room felt like it was spinning. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as tears spilled down their cheeks. The laughter. The swing set. The accident.  

“My daughter,” Avery choked out, the words barely audible.  

Elise nodded, her voice breaking. “Yes.”  

Avery collapsed back to the ground, the weight of the truth crushing them. “I tried to erase her. I tried to forget her.”  

“You thought it would stop the pain,” Elise said softly, kneeling beside them. “But it doesn’t work like that.”  

Avery looked up, their face pale and tear-streaked. “What do I do now?”  

Elise’s expression was gentle, almost maternal. “You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you *let it go.*”  

Avery’s heart pounded as they took a shaky breath, the memory of their daughter’s laughter ringing faintly in their ears. For the first time, they didn’t try to push it away.

## **Chapter 9: The Descent (Part 2)**  

The weight of Elise’s words hung heavy in the air.  

*“You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you let it go.”*  

Avery’s chest rose and fell with ragged breaths, their pulse thundering in their ears. The memory of the little girl—their daughter—felt like an open wound, throbbing with a pain they’d spent so long trying to erase.  

“I don’t know how to,” Avery whispered, their voice shaking.  

“You start by accepting it,” Elise replied softly. “The pain. The truth.”  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, trembling as flashes of the memory returned. The swing set. The sunlight filtering through the trees. The laughter—so bright and full of life. And then the scream. The sickening sound of impact.  

A sob tore through Avery’s throat. They could see it now. *All of it.*  

“I should have saved her,” Avery choked out, their hands clawing at the floor. “I should have been watching—”  

Elise’s hand tightened gently on their shoulder. “You can’t change the past, Avery. You know that.”  

“But I built the machine to try,” Avery shot back, their voice filled with raw desperation. “I thought—if I could erase it—if I could forget—”  

“You thought it would make the guilt disappear,” Elise interrupted, her voice steady but kind. “But it only fractured you. You built the machine to help others forget their pain. But deep down, you were just trying to escape your own.”  

Avery looked up at her, their tear-streaked face pale and hollow. “Then what was the point? What was *any* of this for?”  

Elise knelt down so they were eye level, her gaze unwavering. “It wasn’t to forget, Avery. It was to remember. To accept the truth and find a way to live with it.”  

Avery’s shoulders sagged, the weight of it all crushing them. “I don’t know if I can.”  

Elise’s expression softened. “You can. But you have to want to.”  

The words settled into Avery’s mind like a seed—small, but persistent. They looked down at their trembling hands, the lines on their palms stark against the pale skin. The hands of someone who had tried to *fix* everything… and broken themselves in the process.  

“What happens if I can’t let go?” Avery asked quietly.  

Elise stood, her face shadowed by the dim light of the broken lab. “Then you stay here. Trapped in the loops you created. Reliving the fracture over and over again.”  

The thought sent a chill through Avery’s body. They looked around the lab, at the cracked memory device, at the scorched walls and shattered monitors. The room felt alive in its brokenness—like it was *watching* them, waiting for their decision.  

Avery forced themselves to their feet, their legs unsteady beneath them. “What do I have to do?”  

Elise nodded toward the memory device. “Destroy it.”  

Avery froze, their heart skipping a beat. “What?”  

Elise stepped back, her expression resolute. “You have to let it go. The machine, the memories you tried to erase—all of it. It’s the only way out.”  

Avery turned to face the device. Its surface still glowed faintly, faint tendrils of smoke curling up like ghosts. It looked fragile now—smaller, almost pitiful—but Avery could still feel the power it held over them.  

The power to erase. To forget.  

Avery clenched their fists, torn between fear and anger. *Destroy it.* Could they really do it? Could they really let go?  

“This is your choice, Avery,” Elise said softly from behind them. “No one can make it for you.”  

Avery took a slow step forward, the sound of their shoes scraping against the floor echoing in the silent lab. The closer they got to the device, the more the memories pushed at the edges of their mind—raw and sharp, demanding to be felt.  

The laughter.  
The swing.  
The scream.  

Their daughter’s face—no longer blurred.  

Avery let out a shuddering breath, tears blinding them as they reached out and touched the machine. The surface was cold, lifeless… but it felt like holding their guilt in their hands.  

“You have to let it go,” Elise’s voice repeated, steady and distant.  

Avery’s fingers curled around the edge of the device. For a long moment, they hesitated, their mind screaming at them to stop.  

*What if I can’t live with the truth?*  

But then, a quiet voice inside whispered back:  

*What if you can?*  

Avery gritted their teeth, summoning every ounce of strength left in their broken body. With a cry that echoed through the shattered lab, they wrenched the device off the table and hurled it to the ground.  

The machine exploded in a shower of sparks and glass, the sound like a thousand mirrors breaking at once. Avery staggered back, shielding their face as the room around them began to *shift*. The walls rippled and cracked, the floor splintering like ice beneath their feet.  

“No!” Avery gasped, stumbling. “What’s happening?”  

Elise’s voice rang out, calm and clear amidst the chaos. “You’re waking up.”  

The cracks spread, light pouring through them—blinding, searing white light that filled every corner of the lab. Avery collapsed to their knees, tears streaming down their face as the memories surged through them one final time.  

The laughter. The swing. The scream.  

And then—  

A stillness.  

The pain remained, but it no longer felt like it would consume them. It was *there*—a part of them—but it was real. Honest.  

As the light grew brighter, Avery closed their eyes and whispered, “I’m sorry.”  

A soft breeze brushed against their face, carrying with it a voice—light and full of love.  

“It’s okay, Daddy.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, a sob escaping as the light swallowed them whole.  

---

When they opened their eyes again, Avery was lying on the floor of the lab.  

The room was quiet now. Still. The memory device was gone—nothing left but ash and faint scorch marks on the ground. The monitors were dark, the hum of the machines silenced.  

Avery pushed themselves up, their body aching, but *alive*.  

The reflection was gone. Elise was gone.  

It was just Avery now, alone with the truth.  

They looked down at their hands—solid, real—and took a deep, shaky breath. The pain was still there, but it felt… lighter, somehow. Bearable.  

And for the first time in a long time, the lab didn’t feel like a prison.  

Avery stood, their movements slow but steady. They turned to the door—an ordinary door that now seemed full of possibility.  

With one final glance at the empty lab, they stepped through it, into the light beyond.
