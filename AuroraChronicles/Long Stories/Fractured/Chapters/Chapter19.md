## **Chapter 19: The Loop Tightens (Part 1)**  

Avery’s eyes snapped open to darkness.  

At first, there was nothing—no sound, no light, no sensation beyond the thundering of their heartbeat. Slowly, they became aware of the floor beneath them, cold and smooth, the faint vibrations of the machine humming just out of reach.  

*Still here.*  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body heavy, every movement an effort. The void around them stretched endlessly, unbroken except for a faint pulse of light glowing in the distance. It pulsed like a heartbeat—steady, relentless.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse and small.  

The pulse answered, spreading out in ripples across the ground like waves on water. The hum rose with it, vibrating through Avery’s bones, through the very fabric of the space around them.  

The familiar voice spoke again, soft and hollow, echoing through the darkness.  

*“Welcome back.”*  

Avery froze, dread curling in their stomach. They turned slowly, and there—emerging from the void—was the other Avery. Their doppelgänger, perfect and still, the black void of their eyes reflecting the faint light.  

“You again,” Avery muttered, their voice cracking. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”  

The reflection tilted its head, its expression calm and detached. “Why would I leave? You brought me here.”  

“I didn’t bring you anywhere,” Avery spat, their hands clenching into fists. “You’re the glitch. You’re not real.”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, the corners of their mouth curling upward in a way that made Avery’s skin crawl. “A glitch? Is that what you tell yourself? That everything wrong with you is just a mistake?”  

“Stop,” Avery said, taking a shaky step backward. “You don’t know anything about me.”  

The void trembled, the ground beneath Avery’s feet shuddering as though alive. The pulse of light quickened, growing brighter, and with it came flashes of images—brief, fractured glimpses of memories.  

*The lab. The device humming to life.*  
*Elise shouting, her face contorted in panic.*  
*Marcus’s eyes, cold and distant.*  
*Lena’s smile, fading into blood-stained glass.*  

Avery staggered, clutching their head as the memories surged, relentless and sharp. “Stop it!”  

The doppelgänger stepped forward, their black eyes locking onto Avery’s. “Why are you still fighting this?” they asked softly. “Why are you running from the truth?”  

“I’m not running,” Avery gasped, their vision swimming. “I’m trying to fix it.”  

“Fix it?” The doppelgänger’s smile widened, their voice sharp with amusement. “You think you can *fix* this? Fix yourself?”  

The pulse of light quickened again, the hum rising into a low roar that filled Avery’s ears, drowning out every other thought. The images returned, faster this time—each one a stab of pain as it burned through Avery’s mind.  

*The first time they activated the machine. The spike in the readings.*  
*The warning messages on the console, ignored.*  
*The anomaly—pulsing, spreading, alive.*  

“You let it in,” the doppelgänger said, their voice low and accusing. “You built the machine to erase the parts of yourself you couldn’t bear to face. But it didn’t erase them, Avery. It broke them. It broke *you.*”  

Avery fell to their knees, their hands pressed to their temples as the pressure in their head became unbearable. “No!” they shouted, tears streaming down their face. “I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know!”  

“But you did,” the doppelgänger whispered, crouching in front of Avery. “You knew the risks. You ignored the warnings. And now you’re trapped here, in the ruins of your own creation.”  

The void pulsed again, brighter this time, and the ground beneath Avery cracked like glass. The fragments shimmered, reflecting distorted images of Avery’s face—each one twisted, fractured, broken.  

“I can’t…” Avery sobbed, their voice breaking. “I can’t keep doing this.”  

The doppelgänger leaned closer, their black eyes unblinking. “Then let go,” they said softly. “Stop fighting. Stop running. It’s time to accept what you are.”  

Avery lifted their head, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the light radiating from the fractures in the ground. “And what am I?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, the shadows swirling around them. “A ghost,” they replied. “A shadow of the person you used to be. The machine didn’t erase the parts you wanted to forget—it scattered them, leaving you hollow and incomplete. You don’t exist anymore, Avery. Not really.”  

The words sent a fresh wave of despair crashing over Avery. They looked down at their hands, their breath catching in their throat as the skin shimmered—*glitched*—fading in and out like static.  

“No,” Avery whispered, staring at the fragments of themselves. “No, I’m still here. I’m still—”  

“You’re not,” the doppelgänger interrupted, their voice cold and final. “You’re a loop, Avery. A broken record, repeating the same mistakes, over and over again. You’ll never escape this. You *are* this.”  

The hum reached a deafening peak, the void around Avery trembling violently. Cracks spread outward from the ground, the light spilling through like liquid fire, consuming everything it touched.  

Avery screamed, their voice raw and desperate. “I don’t want this! I don’t want to disappear!”  

The doppelgänger straightened, their form flickering like a mirage. “Then stop running,” they said, their voice barely audible above the roar. “Accept it. Accept *me.*”  

The cracks widened, and the void shattered. Avery felt themselves falling, weightless, as the light swallowed them whole.

When Avery’s eyes opened again, they were somewhere new.  

They lay sprawled on the floor of the lab—or what was left of it. The room was warped and twisted, the walls glitching in and out of focus. The console flickered weakly, its glow dim and erratic, like it was on the verge of shutting down.  

The hum of the machine was faint now, a low vibration in the air, as though the entire system were collapsing under its own weight.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their movements sluggish and unsteady. Their body felt… wrong. Lighter. More *fragile.*  

They looked down at their hands.  

Their skin flickered—transparent in places, their fingers glitching at the edges like corrupted data.  

“No,” Avery whispered, panic rising in their chest. “No, no, no…”  

The console screen blinked to life, a single message appearing in the fractured light:  

**LOOP ERROR DETECTED.**  
**MEMORY INTEGRITY: 12%.**  

Avery stared at the words, their mind spinning. “Memory integrity?” they murmured. “What does that—”  

The screen glitched violently, the text shifting before settling into something new:  

**YOU ARE UNSTABLE.**  

Avery staggered back, their heart pounding. The lab trembled around them, the walls warping as though the space itself were disintegrating.  

“Help me,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “Somebody… help me.”  

But there was no answer.  

The hum of the machine deepened, the console’s glow flaring brightly before beginning to fade. The shadows crept closer from the edges of the lab, twisting and stretching like fingers reaching for Avery.  

And as they watched, the screen flickered one last time, the final message burning itself into their mind:  

**THE LOOP CANNOT BE BROKEN.**  

Avery sank to the floor, their body trembling as the darkness closed in around them.  

“No,” they whispered, tears streaming down their face. “No, please… I don’t want to disappear…”  

The shadows swallowed the room, and the hum of the machine faded into silence.  

And then—  

Nothing.

## **Chapter 19: The Loop Tightens (Part 2)**  

Nothing.  

The void stretched endlessly in all directions—no sound, no light, no sensation. Avery floated in the emptiness, untethered, their thoughts echoing in the cavernous silence.  

*The loop cannot be broken.*  

The words reverberated in their mind like a curse, each repetition sinking deeper, pulling them down into the dark.  

*Is this it?*  

Avery didn’t know if they were speaking, thinking, or imagining the question. They were no longer sure if their body existed at all. The sensation of being *real*—of touch, of breath—had slipped away, replaced by weightlessness and stillness.  

Time didn’t exist here. Avery didn’t exist here.  

And yet—  

A flicker.  

A pulse, faint and distant, like a heartbeat on the edge of hearing.  

Avery’s eyes—if they still had eyes—snapped open. The void rippled, the darkness shifting like water disturbed by a stone. For the first time, something *moved*.  

The pulse came again, stronger this time, and with it, a thread of light—thin and faint—cutting through the black. Avery focused on it, their fragmented thoughts clinging to the light as though it might save them.  

*Follow it.*  

The whisper was small, almost lost in the silence, but it was there—a voice, their voice. Something within them *moved*, a flicker of will buried beneath layers of despair.  

With effort, Avery pushed forward—or maybe they were pulled. The light widened, spreading in ripples through the void, and with it came sound—soft at first, like static, then clearer. A hum.  

The hum of the device.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice raw and trembling. “I can’t go back.”  

The light pulsed in response, growing brighter, sharper. Shapes began to form, fractured images bleeding into focus. Avery saw glimpses of the lab: the table, the console, the device itself. It was like watching the pieces of a broken mirror drift together, each shard snapping into place.  

*The loop cannot be broken.*  

The words flashed across Avery’s mind, sharp and cruel, but the light pulled them forward anyway.  

Suddenly, a voice rang out—distorted, layered, and all too familiar.  

*“Why are you still fighting?”*  

Avery froze, the light faltering as the voice filled the space around them. From the darkness, something emerged.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stepped forward, perfectly calm, its black eyes shining like empty voids. Its presence pulled the light inward, the glow dimming as shadows crawled closer.  

“You’re wasting time, Avery,” the doppelgänger said softly. “This is where it ends.”  

Avery shook their head, teeth gritted. “No. I don’t believe you.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its expression almost pitying. “Believe what you want. It doesn’t change anything. You’re a part of this now. You *are* the machine.”  

“I’m not!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I’m still here. I’m still *me!*”  

The void trembled, the thin light flaring as though it heard Avery’s words. The doppelgänger frowned, its form flickering slightly. “You can’t change this. You’ve seen the truth. You’re broken, Avery—beyond repair.”  

Avery staggered back as the shadows surged closer, the edges of their form dissolving into static. Their limbs felt heavy again, their body glitching, fading.  

“Maybe I am broken,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Maybe I made mistakes. But that doesn’t mean I stop fighting.”  

The doppelgänger’s face twisted into something darker, its voice hardening. “There is no escape. No way out. You’ll only break yourself further.”  

Avery clenched their fists, a spark of defiance flaring in their chest. “Then I’ll break. But I won’t let you win.”  

The light behind them pulsed violently, pushing the shadows back as though feeding on Avery’s resolve. The doppelgänger recoiled slightly, its black eyes narrowing.  

“You’re only prolonging the inevitable,” it hissed.  

“Maybe,” Avery shot back, turning toward the growing light. “But you don’t control me. Not anymore.”  

They pushed forward, toward the light, as the void trembled violently. The shadows clawed at them, tearing at the edges of their mind, but Avery forced themselves to move, their entire being focused on that single thread of light.  

The doppelgänger’s voice rose into a roar, the calm veneer finally cracking. “You can’t escape! *You are me!*”  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice steady now, their path clear. “I’m more than you.”  

The light swelled, blinding and warm, consuming the darkness. Avery felt the shadows recoil, the hum of the machine growing louder, closer, until it was everywhere—inside them, around them, guiding them forward.  

They stepped into the light.  

---

When Avery’s eyes opened, they were back in the lab.  

The walls were intact, the shadows gone. The device sat on the table, its glow faint but steady, as though it had been waiting for them. The console flickered, the screen blank and waiting.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body trembling but whole. For the first time, the hum of the machine didn’t sound threatening. It sounded… calm. Steady.  

They staggered toward the console, the faint glow illuminating their face. The screen blinked to life, and for a long moment, nothing happened.  

Then, slowly, a single line of text appeared.  

**Who are you?**  

Avery stared at the question, their chest tightening. They remembered seeing those words before, when the machine had tried to break them—to erase them.  

But now, something was different.  

Avery’s hands hovered over the console, their fingers shaking. The answer came not as a thought, but as a feeling—something real, something solid.  

“I’m Avery,” they whispered, their voice soft but steady. “And I’m still here.”  

The text on the screen flickered once, then cleared.  

The hum of the machine quieted, its glow dimming until it was little more than a whisper. Avery stepped back, their shoulders sagging as exhaustion pulled at them, but for the first time in what felt like forever, they felt *real*.  

The machine didn’t fight back. The walls didn’t tremble.  

The loop was silent.  

Avery turned toward the lab door, their steps unsteady but resolute. Beyond it, they didn’t know what waited—but they knew one thing: they weren’t running anymore.  

They pushed the door open, stepping into the light.  

And for the first time, they walked forward.
