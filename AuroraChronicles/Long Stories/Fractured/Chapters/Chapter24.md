## **Chapter 24: A Fragile Escape (Part 1)**  

The hum of the machine surrounded Avery like a second heartbeat, steady but insistent, vibrating in their bones as they hovered over the console. Their reflection stared back at them from the smooth, polished surface—tired, fractured, but determined.  

Behind them, Marcus and Elise waited, their silence heavy, charged with expectation.  

“You don’t have to do this alone,” Elise said softly, taking a hesitant step forward. Her voice was steady, but her eyes betrayed the flicker of uncertainty beneath. “Whatever you decide, I’ll help you. We can fix this together.”  

Marcus scoffed, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. “Fix what? This isn’t something you can patch up, Elise. It’s already broken beyond repair.” He turned to Avery, his gaze hard. “If you try to take control of the signal, it’ll destroy you. You know that.”  

Avery’s hands trembled as they hovered over the console. The words on the screen burned into their mind:  

**WHAT WILL YOU DO?**  

It wasn’t just a question—it was a command, one they could feel pulsing through every fiber of their being.  

They looked up, their gaze shifting between Marcus and Elise. “If I destroy the device,” Avery said, their voice low and strained, “what happens to me? To all of this?”  

“You’ll stop it,” Marcus replied instantly. “The fractures, the signal—it’ll all end. And yeah, maybe you’ll lose some things, but at least it’ll be over.”  

Avery turned to Elise, searching for something in her expression—hope, clarity, anything. “And if I don’t destroy it?”  

Elise hesitated, her hands clenching at her sides. “If you merge with it,” she said carefully, “you’ll be able to reshape it. To rewrite the loop, break the cycle, and control what the signal becomes.”  

“But it’ll change me,” Avery whispered, the weight of her words pressing down on them.  

Elise’s gaze dropped to the floor. “Yes,” she admitted softly.  

The room trembled, the machine’s hum rising in pitch, as though urging Avery to decide. The cracks along the walls widened, the light bleeding into the dark, their collision sending ripples of energy through the fractured space.  

Avery closed their eyes, taking a deep, shuddering breath. “I don’t know if I can trust either of you,” they said, their voice trembling. “You’ve both been lying to me, hiding things.”  

Elise flinched, her face tightening with guilt. Marcus’s expression darkened, but he didn’t deny it.  

“You don’t have to trust us,” Elise said quietly. “Trust yourself. You’ve made it this far, Avery. You’ve survived everything the signal’s thrown at you. That means something.”  

“It means they’re lucky,” Marcus muttered, his tone sharp. “Don’t romanticize it, Elise. Survival doesn’t mean they’re immune. If they take this on, it’ll kill them—or worse.”  

The ground shook violently, and a deafening crack split the air as a chasm opened in the floor. Avery staggered back, their heart pounding as the void yawned open beneath them, shadows swirling in its depths.  

The machine’s hum rose into a roar, the console screen flickering wildly as new words appeared:  

**CHOOSE NOW.**  

Avery stumbled forward, their hands gripping the edge of the console as the room threatened to collapse around them. The cracks spread faster, the field of light and shadow outside the lab tearing itself apart.  

“I can’t—” Avery choked out, tears streaming down their face. “I don’t know what to do!”  

“Yes, you do,” Elise said firmly, her voice cutting through the chaos. “You’ve known all along, Avery. The answer isn’t in Marcus, or me, or anyone else. It’s in you. Trust that.”  

Marcus stepped forward, his face grim. “If you don’t destroy it now, you won’t get another chance,” he warned. “The longer you wait, the stronger the signal gets. It’ll take everything from you.”  

Avery turned to face them both, their chest heaving as the weight of their choice threatened to crush them. “What if I’m wrong?” they asked, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus and Elise both opened their mouths to speak, but it wasn’t their voices that answered.  

*“You won’t know until you try.”*  

Avery froze.  

The voice was soft, faint, and achingly familiar. Slowly, they turned toward the sound, their breath catching in their throat.  

Lena stood in the doorway, her figure bathed in light, her dark eyes warm and full of quiet strength. She smiled faintly, tilting her head the way she always did when Avery doubted themselves.  

“Lena?” Avery whispered, their voice cracking.  

Marcus and Elise exchanged confused glances, but neither of them spoke. To them, there was no one there.  

Lena stepped forward, her movements slow and deliberate. “You’ve spent so much time running, Avery,” she said gently. “Running from the pain, the guilt, the truth. But you don’t have to run anymore.”  

Avery’s hands clenched at their sides, tears blurring their vision. “I’m so tired,” they whispered. “I don’t know if I can keep fighting.”  

“You don’t have to fight,” Lena replied, her voice steady and calm. “Not anymore. Just let go.”  

The machine roared louder, the light from the cracks spilling into the room, consuming everything in its path. The console screen flickered again, its words flashing in time with the hum:  

**ERASE. CONTROL. CHOOSE.**  

Lena reached out, her hand hovering just in front of Avery’s. “This is your moment,” she said softly. “Whatever you decide, I’ll be with you.”  

Avery stared at her, their heart breaking. “You’re not real,” they whispered, their voice trembling. “You can’t be real.”  

Lena’s smile didn’t falter. “Does that matter?”  

The room shuddered violently, the cracks splitting wider as the light and shadow surged toward each other, colliding in bursts of raw energy. The machine’s hum reached a deafening crescendo, the air vibrating with the force of it.  

Avery turned back to the console, their reflection staring back at them—fractured but whole, terrified but resolute.  

They took a deep breath, their hands trembling as they reached for the controls.  

Behind them, Marcus shouted something, his voice lost in the chaos. Elise’s words echoed faintly in the distance, pleading, urging them forward.  

But Avery didn’t hear them.  

All they could hear was the hum of the machine and Lena’s voice, soft and steady, grounding them.  

“It’s time, Avery,” Lena said. “You know what to do.”  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face.  

And they made their choice.  

---

When the light consumed them, Avery felt everything—the pain, the fear, the grief—all of it surging through them like a tidal wave.  

And then it was gone.  

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.  

And then—  

A breath.  

A heartbeat.  

A flicker of light.  

Avery opened their eyes.

## **Chapter 24: A Fragile Escape (Part 2)**  

Avery gasped as their eyes fluttered open, their lungs burning with the sharp intake of air. For a moment, they lay still, disoriented, the sound of their own heartbeat pounding in their ears. The ground beneath them felt solid, but cold, and the air carried an eerie, electric stillness.  

They sat up slowly, their vision swimming before it adjusted. The room was quiet—too quiet. The humming of the machine was gone, leaving behind an emptiness that pressed against Avery’s chest.  

Looking around, they realized they were still in the lab, but it was different now. The cracks that had once splintered across the walls were gone. The light and shadow that had been at war were no longer present. Instead, the space felt hollow, like a replica of what the lab used to be—a faint, ghostly echo.  

The device stood on its platform, silent and dark. Its polished surface no longer gleamed with the pulsing life it had once exuded. The console’s screen was blank, its glow extinguished.  

“It’s done,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking the oppressive silence.  

They reached out, their trembling fingers brushing the edge of the console. It felt solid, real, but lifeless. The device—the signal—was gone.  

At least, that’s what they wanted to believe.  

Footsteps echoed behind them, sharp and deliberate. Avery turned to see Marcus approaching, his face pale and drawn, his eyes wary.  

“You’re still here,” he said, his voice low, as though he were speaking to a ghost.  

Avery frowned, pushing themselves to their feet. Their body felt heavy, sluggish, as though it didn’t fully belong to them. “What do you mean?”  

“You made your choice,” Marcus continued, his tone accusatory. “But nothing’s changed, has it? The machine is off, but… we’re still here. Why are we still here, Avery?”  

Avery opened their mouth to respond, but the words died in their throat. Marcus was right. They had expected… something—a resolution, an end. But instead, everything felt suspended, incomplete.  

“Elise,” Avery said suddenly, turning to look for her. “Where’s Elise?”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, his expression darkening. “She’s gone.”  

“What?” Avery’s chest tightened, panic surging through them. “What do you mean she’s gone? Where is she?”  

Marcus hesitated, his eyes darting to the darkened machine. “When you activated it, the field… collapsed. She was standing too close to the edge, and…” He trailed off, his voice thick with something that might have been guilt. “She didn’t make it.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head. “No, that’s not possible. She can’t be gone.”  

Marcus’s gaze hardened. “This is exactly what I warned you about,” he said, his voice rising. “You thought you could fix this, take control, and now look where we are! The signal isn’t gone—it’s still here. It’s *still in you.*”  

Avery staggered back, their hands trembling. “That’s not true,” they said, their voice shaking. “I stopped it. I… I stopped the loop.”  

Marcus took a step closer, his expression dark and unrelenting. “Did you? Look around you, Avery. Does this feel like freedom? Or does it feel like another version of the trap you’ve been in all along?”  

Avery’s breath quickened, their vision blurring as Marcus’s words sank in. The room felt smaller now, the walls pressing in, the air heavy with the weight of something unseen.  

“No,” Avery whispered, clutching their head. “This is different. It has to be different.”  

Marcus’s voice softened, but it was no less cutting. “The signal isn’t gone, Avery. You merged with it, didn’t you? You became part of it. And now it’s in you—controlling you, warping everything around you. You didn’t break the loop. You *became* it.”  

“No!” Avery screamed, their voice raw. “I didn’t… I didn’t want this!”  

The shadows at the edges of the room began to stir, writhing and twisting like living things. Avery stumbled back, their heart pounding as the darkness crept closer, swallowing the corners of the lab.  

Marcus stepped forward, his expression grim. “You can feel it, can’t you?” he said quietly. “The signal. It’s still alive—because you’re keeping it alive.”  

Avery’s knees buckled, and they sank to the floor, their hands gripping their chest as a cold, invasive presence spread through them. The hum of the machine was gone, but something else had taken its place—a faint, rhythmic pulse, like a second heartbeat, deep within their mind.  

“Stop,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Make it stop.”  

Marcus crouched in front of them, his gaze piercing. “You still have a chance,” he said. “Destroy it. Destroy yourself. It’s the only way to end this.”  

Avery’s head snapped up, their tear-streaked face twisted with anger and fear. “You don’t know that!” they shouted. “You don’t know what this is. What I am now.”  

“I know enough,” Marcus replied, his voice cold. “I know the signal is inside you, and as long as it’s alive, no one is safe. Not you. Not anyone else.”  

The shadows surged closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery, wrapping around the edges of the room. The air grew colder, heavier, the pulse in Avery’s mind growing louder, more insistent.  

From somewhere deep within the darkness, a voice whispered—soft, familiar, and impossibly distant.  

*“Avery…”*  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. “Lena?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus stiffened, his eyes narrowing. “What is it?”  

Avery didn’t answer. They turned toward the source of the voice, their gaze locking onto the shadows as they shifted and swirled. For a brief moment, they thought they saw her—Lena—standing just beyond the veil of darkness, her face soft and full of quiet sorrow.  

“Lena,” Avery said again, their voice breaking.  

But the image flickered, distorted, and then it was gone.  

The shadows surged forward, engulfing the room, and Avery screamed as the pulse in their mind erupted into a deafening roar.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes again, they were standing in the field.  

The golden light was gone, replaced by a gray, lifeless haze. The wildflowers had withered, their petals scattered across the cracked, barren ground. The horizon stretched endlessly, but it was empty, devoid of the warmth it once held.  

Avery turned in a slow circle, their chest tightening. The field wasn’t real—it never had been—but now it felt hollow in a way that made their heart ache.  

“Is this it?” they whispered to the emptiness. “Is this what’s left?”  

There was no answer.  

The pulse in their mind was still there, faint but persistent, a constant reminder of what they had become.  

They took a step forward, the brittle ground crunching beneath their feet.  

And then another.  

And another.  

They didn’t know where they were going, or if there was anywhere left to go. But they kept walking, the silence pressing in around them.  

The horizon loomed ahead, vast and unreachable, as the shadows crept along the edges of the world.  

Avery walked on, alone.
