## **Chapter 6: Ghosts of the Mind (Part 1)**  

The whisper slithered through the hallway like a chill wind.  

“Come back, Avery.”  

Avery stood frozen, their gaze locked on the shadowed figure at the end of the hall. The voice—soft and distorted—was familiar, though they couldn’t place it. Every word seemed to vibrate inside their skull, as though the sound were coming from within.  

Elise’s grip tightened around Avery’s arm, her voice tense. “Avery, snap out of it. We have to move.”  

“I know that voice,” Avery murmured, barely hearing her.  

The silhouette took another step forward, its form clearer now. It was tall, but its details were shrouded in shadow—as if light refused to touch it. It tilted its head, its outline wrong somehow, jagged at the edges.  

A wave of nausea churned through Avery’s stomach. *It’s not real. It’s not real.*  

The voice came again, softer now, almost coaxing.  

“You don’t belong here. Come back to where you started.”  

Avery flinched, the words hitting a nerve. Their knees felt weak, their head pounding. The hallway warped, bending inward like a tunnel collapsing around them. The wallpaper seemed to peel in long, curling strips, revealing cracks that bled black behind them.  

Elise shook Avery hard. “*Look at me!*” she snapped.  

Avery’s eyes shot to her. Elise’s face was pale, her expression frantic, but determined. “I don’t care what that thing is. We’re not staying here, do you hear me?”  

Before Avery could answer, another sound broke through the suffocating silence: a door creaking open.  

Both of them turned toward it—one of the doors along the hallway, just a few feet away.  

It had opened on its own. Beyond the threshold was nothing but darkness, thick and impenetrable.  

“I’m not going in there,” Elise muttered under her breath, her gaze darting back to the shadowed figure, which hadn’t stopped advancing. “We need another way out.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their mind spinning. The house—*this* house—wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. They remembered it from their childhood, but only fragments, pieces of a dream-like memory they’d buried long ago. Now it was here, twisting around them, pulling them deeper.  

“It’s me,” Avery whispered, more to themselves than to Elise. “The signal is feeding on *me.* My memories, my fears. That’s why we’re here.”  

“Then stop letting it,” Elise hissed.  

A sudden, louder whisper came from the shadowed figure at the end of the hall. Its voice had grown harsher, angrier, splitting into layers that scraped against Avery’s eardrums.  

*“You can’t run, Avery.”*  

The lights in the hallway flickered violently, buzzing like angry insects. The ground beneath their feet felt unstable, as though the house were breathing, swelling with each pulse of light.  

The figure was closer now—only twenty feet away.  

Elise took a sharp breath, her voice low and urgent. “Fine. If we can’t go through the door, we go back the other way.” She yanked on Avery’s arm, pulling them toward the other end of the hall.  

But the hallway had changed. The way they’d come was now sealed—a solid wall of black, pulsing faintly as though alive.  

Elise cursed under her breath, spinning back toward the darkened doorway that had opened. “We don’t have a choice.”  

Avery hesitated. Every instinct screamed at them to *stay away* from the door, to turn back even if there was nowhere to go. The darkness beyond it felt alive, like it would swallow them whole.  

“It’s a trap,” Avery said faintly, their voice trembling. “It’s pulling us in.”  

Elise turned on them, her eyes blazing. “And what’s your plan? Just stand here and let *that* thing get us?” She gestured toward the figure, now only ten feet away.  

Avery looked back. The figure had stopped walking. It simply stood there, staring—or seeming to stare. Its head tilted again, and Avery swore they saw something twitch in the black void where its face should be.  

“Come back, Avery,” it whispered one last time, almost tender.  

Elise didn’t wait for Avery’s decision. She grabbed them by the hand and bolted toward the dark doorway. Avery stumbled after her, their pulse pounding so hard it drowned out everything else.  

The moment they crossed the threshold, the house behind them disappeared.  

---

Avery’s ears popped, and for a moment, they were blind. The darkness was absolute, a cold, crushing void pressing against their skin, like being buried alive.  

Then, suddenly—  

Light.  

A dim, flickering glow surrounded them. Avery’s vision adjusted, and they realized they were standing in another room.  

It was an operating theater.  

The room was circular, with steep rows of old wooden seats surrounding a single metal table in the center. Rusted medical equipment lay scattered across the floor. Overhead, a single surgical lamp flickered erratically, casting long shadows across the walls.  

“What is this place?” Elise breathed, turning in a slow circle.  

Avery swallowed, their throat dry. “I… I don’t know.”  

The room felt *old*, like it had been abandoned for decades, but it wasn’t just the decay that set Avery on edge. There was something *familiar* about it—like a memory they couldn’t quite reach.  

Elise pointed toward the far wall, where an arched doorway stood. Beyond it was darkness again, but at least it wasn’t the hallway. “There. Let’s go.”  

Before they could move, a sound echoed through the room.  

*Drip… drip… drip.*  

Avery froze, their skin prickling.  

The sound was faint but rhythmic, coming from the center of the room. Slowly, their gaze fell on the metal table.  

Something was on it.  

A dark, viscous liquid dripped steadily from the edge of the table, pooling on the floor below. It was too dark to be water—thicker, heavier. Blood.  

Elise took a sharp step back. “We’re leaving *now.*”  

Avery couldn’t tear their eyes away from the table. Something about it pulled at them—an instinctive, horrible recognition. They took a step closer, their body moving on its own.  

“Avery?” Elise’s voice wavered. “What are you doing?”  

Avery reached the table and stopped.  

There was something lying on the metal surface—something covered by a stained, white sheet. The pool of blood was seeping out from underneath it, spreading toward Avery’s shoes.  

“Avery, *don’t.*” Elise’s voice cracked.  

But Avery couldn’t stop themselves.  

Their hand shook as they reached out and gripped the corner of the sheet. The air in the room seemed to thicken, growing heavier with every second.  

With a sharp tug, Avery pulled the sheet back.  

They stared.  

And their mind *broke.*  

It was *them*.  

Lying on the table—unmoving, pale, and lifeless—was *Avery*. Their own face stared back at them, eyes wide open, empty and glassy. Blood pooled around the table, dripping steadily from a wound they couldn’t see.  

Elise let out a strangled cry. “What the *hell*—”  

The lights above them flared violently, buzzing like a swarm of hornets. Avery stumbled back, the world spinning, their vision swimming with black spots.  

Their dead self’s mouth moved.  

It whispered:  

**“Wake up, Avery.”**  

The room shattered.

Avery screamed.  

The room collapsed in on itself like glass shattering under a hammer. Fragments of the operating theater, the wooden seats, and the metal table all broke apart, dissolving into nothingness. Avery fell backward, weightless, as though they’d been thrown into a void.  

Through the chaos, Elise’s voice cut through the noise, distant but desperate.  

“Avery! *Avery, hold on!*”  

And then, silence.  

---

Avery awoke with a start, gasping for air as though they’d been underwater. The chill in the air bit into their skin, and their fingers dug into cold, damp earth. Dirt clung to their hands and knees, the metallic taste of blood lingering in their mouth.  

They were outside.  

Avery sat up slowly, their breath ragged. The world around them was shrouded in fog—thick and gray, swirling as if alive. Shapes loomed faintly in the mist: trees with bare, claw-like branches stretching into the sky. The ground beneath Avery was uneven, littered with brittle, dead leaves.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice cracked. It barely carried in the suffocating stillness.  

There was no reply.  

Avery pushed themselves unsteadily to their feet. The fog pressed close, muffling sound and warping distance. They couldn’t tell where they were—only that the forest, or whatever this place was, felt wrong. The air carried no sound of wind, no animals, no life. It was too quiet, too still.  

*Where is Elise?* Avery’s mind raced. The last thing they remembered was the body—their own body—on the table. Its lifeless eyes, the whisper. *“Wake up, Avery.”*  

They shivered.  

“Focus,” Avery muttered to themselves, their voice shaking. “This isn’t real. It’s the signal.”  

The thought did little to comfort them.  

A soft sound came from the fog—just ahead.  

*Footsteps.*  

Avery froze, straining to listen. The steps were slow and deliberate, like someone pacing. Avery squinted into the haze, their pulse quickening. A shadow emerged—tall and familiar, its outline jagged around the edges.  

It was the figure.  

The faceless figure, the one that had stalked them through the lab and the house. It stood just beyond the edge of Avery’s vision, still and silent. Its head tilted slightly, as though studying Avery.  

“Stay back,” Avery whispered, stepping away. Their legs trembled.  

The figure took a step forward.  

The sound it made—a low scrape of something heavy against the ground—echoed unnaturally, reverberating through the fog. Avery staggered backward, their breath coming in shallow gasps.  

*Run.*  

The thought ignited like a spark, and Avery turned and bolted into the mist.  

The forest twisted around them as they ran. Trees appeared out of nowhere, gnarled roots snagging at their feet, branches clawing at their face and arms. The fog didn’t thin—it only grew thicker, swallowing everything except the sound of Avery’s pounding footsteps and the relentless scraping behind them.  

No matter how fast they ran, the figure was there. Always just out of sight, its presence pressing closer like a shadow they couldn’t escape.  

Avery’s lungs burned. Their vision swam with exhaustion.  

Then, out of the fog, something new appeared.  

A clearing.  

Avery burst into it, stumbling to a stop. The space was small and perfectly circular, the ground covered in blackened grass. In the center stood a single object: an old wooden swing set.  

Avery stared, chest heaving.  

They knew this place.  

The swing set was weathered with age, its paint long stripped away, leaving the wood splintered and gray. The seats hung by rusted chains, creaking faintly as if moved by an invisible breeze.  

It was the swing set from their childhood home. The one they’d played on before—  

*Before.*  

Avery’s thoughts stuttered, the memory refusing to surface. They stepped closer, drawn to it despite every instinct screaming at them to turn back.  

The sound of scraping footsteps had stopped.  

Avery turned, their stomach dropping.  

The figure was standing at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by fog. It didn’t move.  

“Why?” Avery’s voice cracked. “Why are you doing this to me?”  

The figure tilted its head, slowly. It raised one hand, a shadowy limb that seemed to flicker in and out of focus. The air grew colder, the fog thickening around Avery like smoke.  

Then the figure pointed—at the swing set.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. “No.”  

The figure didn’t move.  

A sudden memory rose in Avery’s mind, unbidden. It was fragmented, like a photograph torn and reassembled wrong. A swing set. A child laughing. The sound of someone calling their name. Then—screaming.  

Avery stumbled back. “No. Stop it.”  

The fog shifted, and a voice whispered—soft, almost pleading.  

“Avery… remember.”  

It wasn’t the faceless figure’s voice this time. It was *familiar*.  

Avery’s head throbbed violently, their vision blurring. They dropped to their knees, clutching their temples as the whispering grew louder.  

“Remember.”  

The images flooded their mind in pieces—flashes of something they’d buried long ago.  

The swing set. A younger version of themselves, laughing as they swung higher and higher. A woman standing nearby—Avery’s mother. Her face was soft, smiling, but the memory wavered like a reflection in rippling water.  

Then—  

A scream.  

The memory shifted violently. The swing snapped. Avery felt themselves falling, the world spinning. Their mother’s scream shattered the air, mingling with the sharp, sickening crack of impact.  

Avery gasped, their body shaking. The memory shattered, and they were back in the clearing, on their knees. Tears burned hot trails down their face as they gasped for breath.  

The fog had lifted slightly. The swing set stood silent, the chains still.  

A voice whispered softly, from behind them.  

“You buried it, Avery. But it’s still there.”  

Avery turned slowly, their body heavy with dread.  

The faceless figure was gone.  

Standing in its place was Avery’s mother.  

She looked just as she did in their childhood—kind, gentle, but something was wrong. Her eyes were too dark, and her smile too wide. She took a step forward, the rustling of her footsteps unnatural in the still clearing.  

“Avery,” she said softly. “Come home.”  

Avery shook their head, scrambling backward. “You’re not real. You’re not—”  

Her expression didn’t change, but her voice deepened, distorted, as though layered with something darker.  

“You don’t belong here, Avery.”  

Avery’s vision swam. The clearing seemed to ripple, the swing set creaking loudly now, the chains groaning under invisible weight. The fog began closing in again, suffocating and dark.  

The ground trembled beneath them, and the whisper returned—dozens of voices this time, overlapping in a maddening chorus.  

“Wake up, Avery.”  

“Wake up.”  

“Wake up.”  

Avery pressed their hands to their ears, screaming.
