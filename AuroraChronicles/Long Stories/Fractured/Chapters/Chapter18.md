## **Chapter 18: The Ghost in the Machine (Part 1)**  

Avery sat curled on the floor of the flickering lab, their body shaking, their breath coming in ragged gasps. The console glowed faintly in the fractured darkness, its words burning into their mind:  

**Who are you?**  

They couldn’t answer. They didn’t know. Every memory they reached for dissolved like smoke in their hands, leaving them with nothing but fragments—faces, voices, moments that no longer fit together.  

*You let it in.*  

The voice echoed in the void, a whisper that sent icy tendrils crawling across Avery’s skin. “Stop,” they whispered, their voice hoarse. “Please stop.”  

The shadows in the room stirred, shifting like living smoke. The walls rippled, the hum of the machine deepening into a low, resonant growl that vibrated through Avery’s bones.  

And then—  

*“Why are you still here?”*  

Avery froze. The voice was different this time—familiar, soft, and unmistakably *their own*.  

They lifted their head slowly, their gaze falling on the far side of the room. Through the haze of glitching shadows, a figure stepped into view.  

It was Avery.  

The doppelgänger stood there, its black, featureless eyes glinting faintly in the fractured light. It smiled, a slow and unnerving curve of its lips.  

“You don’t belong here,” the doppelgänger said softly, its voice layered and distorted, yet undeniably Avery’s.  

Avery scrambled back, pressing themselves against the cold floor. “What are you?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its gaze unblinking. “I’m you,” it replied. “Or what’s left of you.”  

Avery shook their head, tears burning in their eyes. “No. You’re a lie. A glitch.”  

The other Avery took a step closer, the shadows curling around its feet like ink. “A glitch?” It laughed, the sound hollow and strange. “Is that what you tell yourself? That this isn’t real? That *I’m* not real?”  

“You’re not!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “You’re just a piece of the signal—a trick!”  

The doppelgänger stopped, its smile fading. “No, Avery. I’m what you refuse to see. I’m the truth you’re hiding from.”  

Avery flinched, their mind spinning. “What truth?”  

The figure crouched, staring at Avery with those black, endless eyes. “You let it in, remember? The signal. The machine. You built it, and you let it rewrite you.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head violently. “I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know!”  

“But you did,” the doppelgänger said, its voice calm and patient, as though speaking to a child. “And now you’re here, trapped in the ruins of your own mind.”  

Avery stared at the figure, their breath shallow. “This… this isn’t my mind. This is the lab. This is the device—”  

The room flickered violently, the walls glitching like a corrupted screen. The doppelgänger spread its arms, gesturing to the crumbling space around them. “What lab? Look around you, Avery. This place isn’t real. It’s *you.*”  

The words struck like a knife, and Avery’s vision swam. They clutched their head, the pressure building again, the hum of the machine louder now—louder and deeper, like it was resonating with something inside of them.  

“No,” Avery whispered. “No, no, no.”  

“You can’t fight it anymore,” the figure said softly, stepping closer. “It’s already inside you. It’s *become* you. You’re just a ghost, Avery. A shadow of what you were.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted violently, bile rising in their throat. “Stop. Just stop.”  

The doppelgänger crouched lower, its face inches from Avery’s, its voice a whisper. “Why keep running? Why not let it end?”  

The hum crescendoed, drowning out everything else, the walls cracking and collapsing into darkness. Avery screamed, the sound ripped from their chest as the figure reached out, its black eyes swallowing them whole—  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

Avery woke up lying on a cold, metallic floor. The hum was gone, replaced by dead, empty stillness. They pushed themselves upright, their movements sluggish and painful, their limbs heavy as stone.  

The room around them was vast and dark, stretching into shadows in every direction. Lines of faint light glowed along the floor, tracing intricate patterns like circuits spreading infinitely outward.  

Avery staggered to their feet, blinking through the haze clouding their vision. “Where… where am I?”  

The answer came not as a voice but as a feeling—an awareness seeping into their mind like ink spreading through water.  

They were inside the machine.  

The realization hit Avery like a physical blow. They turned in a slow circle, the emptiness pressing in on all sides, suffocating and infinite. “No,” they whispered, their voice echoing in the void. “No, this isn’t real. This isn’t *real.*”  

The lines of light on the floor pulsed faintly, and as Avery watched, they began to shift—rearranging into words that stretched across the vast, dark space.  

**YOU ARE HERE.**  

Avery stumbled back, their heart pounding in their chest. “Stop this!” they screamed into the void. “Let me out!”  

The lines shifted again, faster this time, forming a new message:  

**YOU LET ME IN.**  

The shadows around them stirred, the darkness thickening like a living thing. Avery’s mind raced as they backed away, their breath coming in short, panicked gasps.  

A voice echoed through the void—deep, mechanical, and layered with countless whispers.  

*“You are me now, Avery.”*  

“No!” Avery shouted, clutching their head as the sound reverberated inside their skull. “You’re lying!”  

The lights pulsed brighter, spreading outward in ripples, as the voice whispered again.  

*“You can’t erase me. I’m already inside you.”*  

The ground beneath Avery shifted, the metallic surface warping and cracking as though something massive were pushing up from below. Avery staggered, falling to their knees, the pressure in their head building to unbearable levels.  

“Stop!” they screamed. “Get out of my head!”  

But the voice only laughed, low and resonant, echoing endlessly in the dark.  

*“You can’t escape yourself, Avery.”*  

The lights blazed, blinding, and Avery’s world shattered once more into darkness.

## **Chapter 18: The Ghost in the Machine (Part 2)**  

When the darkness receded, Avery was on their knees, their hands pressed against the cold, metallic surface beneath them. Their head throbbed with pain, and their body felt like it had been hollowed out, the weight of everything unbearable.  

The endless void stretched before them, silent now, the glowing circuits carved into the floor pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. Avery forced themselves to look up, the lines of light swirling and shifting, rearranging into words.  

**YOU CAN’T ERASE ME.**  

The message burned into Avery’s mind, as though the machine—no, the *signal*—had carved it there.  

“You’re wrong,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse and shaking. “I can stop you. I can—”  

The words on the ground flickered, shifting again, faster this time.  

**YOU ARE ME. I AM YOU.**  

“No!” Avery screamed, forcing themselves to their feet. “You’re not me! You’re just a glitch—a mistake!”  

The void rippled in response, the shadows deepening at the edges of the space, like something alive, something vast. A low hum began to rise again, vibrating through Avery’s bones.  

“Where are you?” Avery demanded, spinning in a slow circle. “Show yourself!”  

The hum grew louder, and then—  

A voice.  

*“You still don’t understand, do you?”*  

Avery’s breath caught in their chest. The voice was their own, yet deeper, distorted, layered with static. It was *everywhere*, pressing down on them like a weight they couldn’t escape.  

The circuits on the floor flared brighter, and from the swirling light, a figure began to emerge. It stepped forward slowly, its form coalescing from the void like it had been there all along.  

It was Avery.  

Not the glitching doppelgänger, not the shadowy form. This version was different—perfectly clear, perfectly composed. Every detail was sharp: the curve of their jaw, the line of their shoulders, the way their dark eyes reflected the light.  

But something was wrong.  

The other Avery’s expression was calm, serene even, but their eyes were empty. Black. Void.  

“You’re not me,” Avery said, their voice trembling.  

The other Avery smiled faintly, tilting their head. “Aren’t I?”  

“I don’t know what you are,” Avery shot back, taking a shaky step backward, “but you’re not me. You can’t be.”  

The figure stepped closer, its movements unnervingly smooth, as though it weren’t bound by the laws of reality. “I’m everything you’ve tried to forget,” it said softly. “Everything you buried. Everything you refused to face.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their heart pounding in their chest. “That’s not true.”  

The other Avery gestured to the endless void around them, its black eyes unblinking. “Look around you. This place—it’s all you. Every shadow. Every glitch. Every crack in reality. You created this when you let me in.”  

“I didn’t let you in!” Avery shouted, their voice breaking. “I didn’t know what the signal would do!”  

The figure stopped a few feet away, their gaze locking onto Avery’s. “You knew,” it said softly. “You *always* knew.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow. Their legs gave out, and they fell to their knees, their breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps.  

Memories surged forward—images that had been buried, hidden, denied. The first activation of the device. The anomaly in the readings. Elise’s warnings. Marcus’s anger. The way Avery had looked at the data and told themselves it didn’t matter.  

*It was fine.*  

*It would work.*  

The voice of the machine whispered in the back of their mind, echoing like a drumbeat.  

*You already knew.*  

Avery clutched their head, shaking uncontrollably. “No. No, I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know it would *break* everything!”  

The other Avery crouched down in front of them, their voice soft and patient, like a parent explaining something to a child. “You can’t hide anymore. You built the machine. You gave the signal life. And when you realized what it was—what it could do—you let it in.”  

Avery looked up slowly, tears streaming down their face. “Why?” they whispered. “Why me?”  

The figure smiled faintly. “Because you were broken long before the machine. The signal didn’t create this place, Avery. It only gave form to what was already inside you.”  

Avery froze, their mind reeling. “What are you saying?”  

The other Avery’s black eyes seemed to deepen, drawing Avery in, swallowing everything else. “You were trying to escape yourself. The guilt. The loss. The *truth*. You wanted to forget, so you built the perfect tool to erase it all. But instead of erasing the pain…”  

The void around them trembled, the shadows rippling like waves.  

“…you erased yourself.”  

The realization slammed into Avery like a freight train, leaving them gasping, broken. They remembered it all now—the late nights in the lab, the moments of doubt they had ignored, the small fractures in their mind they had dismissed as exhaustion.  

And then Lena.  

The accident.  

The unbearable grief.  

The machine had been their answer—their escape. They had poured everything into building it, convincing themselves it would help others, that it would erase pain, erase suffering.  

But deep down, they had built it to erase *themselves*.  

Avery sank forward, their forehead pressing against the cold ground. The void was alive now, the shadows curling around them like vines. The hum of the machine grew louder, vibrating through their body, through their mind.  

The other Avery stood, their voice calm and final. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it? To disappear. To stop existing. To let go.”  

Avery’s hands trembled against the floor. “I didn’t… I didn’t know…”  

The figure’s black eyes stared down at them, unfeeling. “But you know now.”  

The ground beneath Avery cracked, the void splitting open into endless darkness. The hum reached a deafening roar, and the shadows surged forward, pulling at Avery’s body, dragging them down into the abyss.  

“You can still let go,” the other Avery whispered. “It’s not too late.”  

Avery closed their eyes, the darkness swallowing them whole.  

And somewhere, faintly, a voice echoed in their mind—  

*“Remember.”*
