## **Chapter 10: Fragments Rebuilt (Part 1)**  

The light beyond the door was blinding at first, a stark contrast to the suffocating darkness Avery had lived in for so long. For a moment, they stood frozen, unsure if their feet were still on solid ground or if they had stepped into another illusion.  

But then, the light began to soften. Shadows formed, shapes sharpening into clarity, and as the brightness dimmed, Avery saw where they were.  

They were standing in the middle of a park.  

The grass was lush and green, speckled with small white flowers swaying in the breeze. Trees lined the edges of a pathway that stretched ahead, their leaves a deep, vibrant emerald. A faint scent of lilac lingered in the air, carried by the breeze. The world was calm, peaceful—*real.*  

Avery blinked, adjusting to the new reality. Their heart raced as they looked down at their hands, turning them over carefully. No tremors. No glitches in their vision. Just steady, solid flesh and bone.  

“This can’t be real,” Avery muttered, their voice hoarse. “It’s too… clear.”  

And yet, every sensation told them otherwise. The breeze was cool against their skin. The sunlight warm on their face. Even the distant laughter of children playing somewhere nearby felt *tangible* in a way the illusions never had.  

Avery turned slowly, scanning the horizon for any sign of familiarity. The park stretched out in all directions—serene and empty, save for a single bench near the path. A woman sat there, her back to Avery, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders.  

Avery’s breath caught.  

“Elise?”  

They hesitated for a moment, then forced their legs to move, each step slow and deliberate. The closer they got, the stronger the gnawing in their chest became—grief, hope, fear, all swirling together.  

The woman remained still, staring out at the open field ahead. Avery finally reached her and came to a stop a few feet away, their voice barely above a whisper.  

“Elise?”  

The woman turned.  

It wasn’t Elise.  

Avery flinched, an instinctive sting of disappointment hitting them. The woman had the same dark hair, the same calm presence, but her face was unfamiliar. Her eyes, however, were something else entirely.  

They weren’t just looking *at* Avery. They were *studying* them.  

“You’ve come far,” the woman said softly, her voice smooth and even. “I wasn’t sure you would.”  

Avery frowned. “Who… are you?”  

The woman tilted her head slightly, as though considering the question. “I’m a guide. A fragment, like all the others you’ve seen. Only this time, I’m here to help you finish.”  

“Finish?” Avery asked, their tone wary. “Finish what?”  

The woman gestured to the path ahead, the cracks of gravel catching the sunlight. “You’ve started to face your truth. You’ve begun to let go. But there’s still one final choice you have to make.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened. “What choice?”  

The woman stood, her movements fluid and deliberate. “You’ve been clinging to the past—running from it, hiding from it, burying it under illusions. Now that you’ve remembered, the question is… what will you do with the truth?”  

Avery stiffened. The words struck deep, as though this woman had reached into their chest and pulled the thought straight from their core. “I don’t understand.”  

The woman smiled faintly, though there was no malice in it—only sadness. “You’ve been given a second chance, Avery. A chance to rebuild. To live again. But you have to decide what that life looks like.”  

Avery’s mind swirled. A second chance? The idea felt impossible. How could they live with this truth, this pain, and somehow move forward? It felt like a weight too heavy to bear.  

“What if I can’t?” Avery asked quietly, their voice almost childlike. “What if I don’t deserve that chance?”  

The woman’s gaze softened. “Deserving has nothing to do with it. Pain is a part of you now. But it doesn’t have to define you.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “And if I don’t choose?”  

The woman looked past them, toward the edge of the park where the trees seemed to stretch into darkness, their forms twisting and unnatural. “Then the loops will find you again. They always do.”  

A chill ran through Avery’s body as they turned to follow her gaze. The shadows beyond the trees were already creeping closer, tendrils of darkness curling toward the path like smoke.  

*The loops.*  

Avery remembered the void, the endless cycles of fragmented realities. The crushing feeling of being trapped with no escape.  

“No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “I can’t go back to that. I won’t.”  

“Then walk forward,” the woman said, her voice gentle but firm. “Let the truth guide you. Even if it hurts.”  

Avery looked at the path ahead. It stretched far into the distance, disappearing into a golden haze. They had no idea what lay at the end—whether it was salvation, redemption, or something worse.  

But the choice was theirs to make.  

For the first time in a long time, Avery felt the stirrings of something they thought they’d lost: hope.  

They looked back at the woman, who nodded once, as though reading their decision. “Go on. You’re ready.”  

Avery swallowed hard and turned toward the path. Their steps were hesitant at first, but as they moved, the ground beneath their feet felt steadier. Realer.  

The sun climbed higher in the sky, and with every step, the shadowy tendrils fell further behind, shrinking back into the trees.  

*Let the truth guide you,* the woman had said.  

Avery kept walking, one step at a time, the echoes of laughter and pain trailing behind them like ghosts. They weren’t gone, but they were quieter now.  

For once, Avery didn’t turn back.

## **Chapter 10: Fragments Rebuilt (Part 2)**  

Avery walked for what felt like hours. The path beneath their feet seemed endless, stretching into the golden haze like a ribbon that tied them to some unseen destination. At first, every step felt weighted—hesitant and unsure—as if they were afraid the ground would dissolve into another illusion.  

But it didn’t.  

The sunlight remained warm. The sky above stayed clear, a soft expanse of pale blue that seemed to breathe with life. Every step forward felt more *real* than the last, grounding Avery in a way they hadn’t felt for years.  

The tendrils of shadow that had once crept at their heels had long vanished. Avery didn’t dare turn back to look, but deep inside, they knew: the loops wouldn’t reach them here. Not as long as they kept moving forward.  

For the first time, there was no one else. No ghost of Elise. No strange fragments pulling at their mind. Just Avery and the silence.  

It was unsettling at first, the absence of noise almost deafening. For so long, they had been surrounded by echoes—memories, machines, voices whispering things they didn’t want to hear. Now, in the stillness, Avery was left with only themselves.  

And the truth.  

The truth hurt, but it didn’t destroy them.  

It was there as they walked—a quiet companion. It reminded them of their failures, of the moments that had broken them. Of the little girl whose laughter they’d held onto and whose absence had shattered their world.  

*You can’t change the past.*  

The words rang in Avery’s mind like a steady drumbeat, but now, they weren’t as sharp. They were *true.* And like all truths, they carried weight, but they also carried something else—freedom.  

The path began to change.  

The gravel gave way to smooth, white stone that shone in the sunlight. The golden haze ahead began to lift, revealing the edges of a structure. As Avery moved closer, their breath caught.  

A bridge.  

It was long and narrow, made of the same white stone as the path, and it stretched out over a vast, shimmering expanse of water. The surface of the water rippled with light, reflecting the sky above in colors Avery couldn’t name—soft blues, silvers, and faint hints of gold.  

The bridge seemed impossibly delicate, almost fragile, yet it didn’t waver. It waited for Avery like a promise, an unspoken challenge.  

Avery hesitated at the edge. The space ahead felt different from the path they had been walking—this wasn’t just about moving forward anymore. The bridge felt final.  

*What if I fall?*  

The thought came unbidden, sharp and sudden. The water below looked calm, but Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that it held more than reflections. It felt *alive*—waiting, watching.  

A gust of wind swept across the bridge, tugging at Avery’s clothes like an invitation.  

“This is it,” they whispered to themselves, their voice almost lost in the breeze.  

Their fingers curled into fists, steadying their breath. This was the moment of choice.  

Avery thought back to the machine, to the shattered lab, to all the years they had spent trying to erase the unbearable. And now, here they were—standing at the edge of something new, something unknown.  

Letting go wasn’t easy. It felt like stepping off the edge of everything they’d ever known.  

But clinging to the past—to the guilt and the pain—hadn’t brought Avery peace.  

It had only fractured them.  

*“You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you let it go.”*  

Elise’s voice echoed softly in their mind, carrying them forward.  

Avery placed one foot on the bridge.  

The stone was solid beneath their weight.  

They took another step.  

And another.  

The bridge didn’t break. The water below remained calm, rippling gently as though cheering them on.  

With every step, the weight on Avery’s chest grew lighter. The memories didn’t disappear—Avery could still feel them, still see their daughter’s face when they closed their eyes. But they weren’t being crushed by it anymore.  

The pain was there, but so was something else: a quiet, tentative strength.  

Avery reached the center of the bridge and paused, looking out over the vast water stretching endlessly in every direction. For the first time in a long time, they felt small—but not insignificant. The world felt wide and open, and there was a place for them in it.  

Somewhere in the water’s shimmering depths, Avery thought they heard laughter—soft and distant, like a memory carried on the wind.  

It didn’t hurt.  

It made them smile.  

Avery closed their eyes and let the breeze wash over them.  

“Goodbye,” they whispered, not to anyone in particular, but to the part of themselves that had been trapped for so long. The part that had been afraid to face the truth.  

They opened their eyes and began walking again.  

The bridge stretched ahead, endless and full of possibility.  

And Avery walked on, leaving the fractures behind.
