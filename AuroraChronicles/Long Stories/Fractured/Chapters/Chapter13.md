## **Chapter 13: A World of Illusions (Part 1)**  

The hallway outside the secret facility twisted unnaturally as Avery stumbled forward, every step weighed down by something more than exhaustion. The flickering overhead lights cast jagged shadows on the concrete walls, making everything feel warped, as if the very air around them had begun to fold in on itself.  

Their breaths came quick and shallow, Elise’s footsteps echoing beside them. She was close—always close—but felt like a ghost moving just out of sync with reality. Avery kept their gaze fixed straight ahead, refusing to look at the shifting edges of the walls or the doors that now seemed to melt into the concrete.  

“What did you do back there?” Elise’s voice broke through the strained silence, her words sharp and accusing.  

Avery swallowed, their throat dry as sandpaper. “I didn’t—”  

“Don’t say you didn’t do anything!” Elise snapped, stopping suddenly. Avery turned to look at her, and for a moment, something was off about her face. The shadows clung to her skin too tightly, like ink bleeding into the edges of her features.  

Avery blinked, and it was gone. Elise was just Elise again—frustrated, scared, and angry—but Avery felt a cold shiver crawl up their spine.  

“This isn’t me,” Avery muttered, more to themselves than to Elise. “This isn’t real. It’s the device. It’s… in everything.”  

Elise stepped forward, her expression softening slightly. “You’re not making sense. I need you to focus. We need to get out of here before—”  

A noise interrupted her.  

It was faint at first—a slow, rhythmic tapping, like footsteps echoing far down the corridor. Avery’s blood ran cold as the sound grew louder. Closer.  

*Tap… tap… tap.*  

They turned toward the source, the far end of the hallway swallowed in darkness. The lights above them flickered violently now, each pulse of darkness stretching longer than the last. Avery felt a familiar pressure in their skull, like invisible fingers pressing deep into their brain.  

“You hear that, right?” Avery whispered.  

Elise nodded, her eyes fixed on the darkness. She reached for Avery’s arm and tugged gently. “Come on. We’re not waiting to see what that is.”  

The two of them started walking again, faster this time. Avery’s heart pounded in rhythm with their steps, the tapping behind them seeming to match their pace perfectly. It didn’t slow. It didn’t speed up. It just… followed.  

As they rounded a corner, Avery nearly froze.  

The corridor stretched ahead in a perfect, endless line, every door along its length identical—gray, windowless, and slightly warped. The fluorescent lights buzzed like angry insects, their glow paling as though drained of energy. Avery realized with growing horror that the hallway was **too** straight. Too perfect.  

“What is this place?” Elise murmured, her voice barely audible.  

Avery didn’t answer. The question hung heavy in the air, unanswerable and irrelevant, because Avery knew there was no “place” anymore. Not really. The walls were an illusion. The hallway wasn’t a hallway at all.  

It was a trap.  

“Wait—stop!” Avery yanked Elise back just as she reached for one of the doors.  

Elise spun toward them, her expression confused and irritated. “Avery, what are you—?”  

“Look.” Avery pointed at the door.  

At first glance, it was unremarkable—steel gray like all the others. But as they watched, faint ripples pulsed across its surface, like a reflection on disturbed water. Avery squinted, their pulse quickening as a shape formed just beneath the surface of the door.  

It was a hand.  

A human hand, pressed against the other side.  

The outline of fingers stretched out, pressing harder, harder, until the steel seemed to *bulge*.  

Elise took a step back. “Jesus Christ.”  

The hand began to twist, its shape warping into something unnatural. The fingers elongated, sharp at the tips like claws. Another hand appeared beside it, then another. And then came the face.  

A faceless, hollow impression of a head pushed against the door from the inside, its blank features impossibly smooth. The mouth stretched wide, a silent scream distorting its shape.  

Avery stumbled back, grabbing Elise’s arm. “We have to move. Now.”  

The tapping sound grew louder—closer—pounding now like hammer blows against the floor.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap. TAP.*  

Avery turned and sprinted down the hallway, dragging Elise with them. They didn’t dare look back, but they could feel it—the tapping, the bulging doors, the **thing** following them. The sound filled the air, deafening and relentless, as the walls around them began to *melt*.  

“Avery!” Elise shouted.  

Ahead of them, the hallway split into two paths—identical and impossible to tell apart. Avery skidded to a stop, their chest heaving as they looked left, then right.  

“Which way?” Elise demanded.  

Avery’s mind raced, sweat dripping into their eyes. Both hallways looked the same, each stretching into a void of flickering lights and rippling shadows.  

“You have to choose!” Elise grabbed Avery’s shoulders, her grip hard enough to snap them out of their daze.  

Avery turned left.  

“This way!”  

They ran.  

The hallway twisted, curving in ways that shouldn’t have been possible. Avery’s legs burned, but the tapping sound followed, never fading. It felt as though the entire world around them was **watching**, bending and shifting just to keep them trapped.  

Finally, they reached another door at the end of the corridor. This one was different—heavy, reinforced, with a small circular window set into its center. Light—real, natural light—spilled through the glass, and Avery felt a flicker of hope stab through the haze of fear.  

“Go!” Elise shouted, pushing Avery forward.  

Avery grabbed the door handle and pulled with all their strength. It didn’t budge.  

“No!” Avery gritted their teeth and yanked again. “It’s locked!”  

Elise slammed her shoulder against it, the two of them straining to force it open. Behind them, the tapping stopped.  

The sudden silence was worse.  

Avery turned their head slowly, dread pooling in their stomach.  

The figure was there. Standing in the middle of the hallway.  

Faceless. Still. Waiting.  

The air grew heavy, and Avery’s vision swam as the figure raised a single hand, pointing directly at them.  

The door behind Avery suddenly gave way, the handle slipping from their grip as it swung open. Bright light flooded the hallway, blinding them. Elise grabbed Avery’s arm and pulled them through, slamming the door shut behind them.  

Avery stumbled to the ground, gasping for breath. The sound of the tapping was gone, replaced by the gentle hum of… something.  

When they opened their eyes, they froze.  

They were back in the lab.  

Again.  

The console glowed faintly, waiting. The device sat at the center of the room, polished and unassuming.  

Elise cursed under her breath, her voice shaking. “Avery… what’s happening?”  

Avery didn’t respond. They couldn’t.  

Because this time, the screen already had a message waiting for them:  

**Welcome back, Avery.**

## **Chapter 13: A World of Illusions (Part 2)**  

The words on the screen—**Welcome back, Avery**—seemed to pulse, as though alive. Avery’s chest tightened, their breath caught in their throat. It was waiting for them. *Watching.*  

Elise staggered to her feet, running a trembling hand through her hair. “This isn’t happening,” she muttered, her voice thin and broken. “We made it out. I know we did.”  

Avery stood slowly, their legs unsteady, their gaze locked on the console. “No,” they whispered. “We didn’t. It’s pulling us back in.”  

Elise turned to them sharply. “What do you mean ‘pulling us back’? What the hell is this, Avery?!”  

Avery shook their head, trying to steady the whirlwind of thoughts in their mind. “The device. The signal. It’s not just data, Elise—it’s **alive**. It’s rewriting everything. Us, this place, reality itself. Every time we try to escape, it resets us. Brings us back to… here.”  

Elise froze, her face pale. “A loop,” she murmured.  

Avery nodded, the truth settling over them like ice. “It’s learning. Adapting. The more we fight it, the stronger it gets.”  

Elise let out a short, bitter laugh, the sound brittle and hollow. “So what are we supposed to do? Give up? Let it win?”  

“I don’t know,” Avery admitted, their voice shaking. “But we can’t keep running. It’ll just pull us back.”  

Elise turned away, pacing the length of the lab. The hum of the machines seemed louder now, vibrating deep in Avery’s bones, as though the signal was spreading through the very walls.  

“You’re saying this thing—this *signal*—is creating all of this?” Elise asked, gesturing to the lab. “The hallways. The figure. Even Marcus?”  

Avery hesitated. “I don’t know if it’s creating them, or if they’re… pieces of us. Fractured memories. Twisted versions of reality.”  

“Pieces of us?” Elise’s voice cracked, her face twisted in disbelief. “That’s insane, Avery.”  

“Is it?” Avery shot back, their voice rising. “After everything we’ve seen? The device was never just a tool, Elise. It’s doing something to us. To *me*.”  

The console screen flickered, pulling their attention back. A new message appeared, the words jagged and broken:  

**YOU CAN’T ESCAPE YOURSELF.**  

Elise’s breath caught. “What does that mean?”  

Avery stared at the screen, the words searing into their mind. *You can’t escape yourself.*  

Suddenly, the lab lights flickered, and the hum grew deafening. Avery clutched their head, the pressure building in their skull, sharp and relentless. The walls around them rippled, the edges distorting like heat waves.  

“Avery!” Elise’s voice sounded distant, warped, like it was being pulled through water.  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, but it didn’t help. Images flashed across the darkness—fragments of memories, distorted and out of order.  

The faceless figure.  

Marcus’s warnings.  

The child’s laughter.  

The sound of glass shattering.  

“Avery!” Elise shouted again, and this time, Avery felt her hands gripping their shoulders, shaking them. “Snap out of it!”  

The pressure in Avery’s skull released all at once, and they gasped, collapsing forward. Elise caught them, helping them stay upright.  

“What the hell was that?” Elise whispered, her voice trembling.  

Avery blinked, their vision slowly clearing. “It’s the signal,” they rasped. “It’s breaking us down. Layer by layer.”  

Elise looked toward the console again, her expression hardening. “Then we need to shut it down.”  

Avery’s stomach turned. “How? It’s everywhere. It’s in the device, the systems… us.”  

“There has to be a way,” Elise insisted, her voice sharp with desperation. “There’s always a way.”  

Before Avery could respond, the lab door creaked open.  

They both froze, the sound splitting the silence like a knife. The door swung inward slowly, the hallway beyond bathed in darkness.  

Elise grabbed Avery’s arm. “Don’t.”  

But Avery couldn’t help it. They stepped forward, peering into the blackness.  

“Marcus?” Avery called out, though their voice was barely above a whisper.  

For a moment, there was nothing. Just silence.  

Then—  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*  

Avery staggered back, the sound sending chills through their body. Elise grabbed their arm again, pulling them away from the door. “It’s coming,” she whispered.  

The lights in the lab flickered again, the hum of the machines rising to an unnatural pitch. Avery turned to the console just as another message appeared on the screen:  

**IT’S TOO LATE.**  

A sharp, metallic screech echoed through the lab, and Avery spun around to see the faceless figure step through the doorway.  

It moved slowly, deliberately, its blank head tilted slightly as though studying them. The shadows seemed to ripple and stretch in its wake, swallowing the light.  

“Run!” Elise shouted, pulling Avery toward the far side of the room.  

The figure didn’t follow immediately. It simply stood there, watching. Waiting.  

Avery’s heart pounded as they reached the far wall. Elise frantically searched for an escape—anything that would get them out—but the walls were solid, unyielding.  

“We’re trapped,” she muttered, panic rising in her voice.  

Avery turned back to the figure. It had taken a step closer now, its movements unnaturally smooth, as though it were gliding across the floor.  

“We have to face it,” Avery said suddenly, their voice shaking but resolute.  

Elise stared at them. “Are you out of your mind?”  

“Running doesn’t work,” Avery replied, their gaze locked on the figure. “It just brings us back here. We have to stop it. Somehow.”  

The figure took another step, the shadows pooling closer. Avery felt the pressure return to their skull, heavier this time, like something trying to push its way inside.  

*You can’t escape yourself.*  

Avery clenched their fists, forcing themselves to stand tall. “What do you want?” they demanded, their voice echoing through the lab.  

The figure stopped. For a moment, everything was still—the shadows, the hum, even the flickering lights.  

Then, it tilted its head again, and for the first time, it spoke.  

The voice was Avery’s own.  

“I want you to remember.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow, knocking the air from their lungs.  

Elise grabbed their arm, her voice frantic. “Avery, don’t listen to it!”  

The lights flared violently, blinding them both. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as the hum crescendoed into a deafening roar.  

And then—  

Silence.  

When Avery opened their eyes, they were alone.  

The lab was gone. The figure was gone.  

They stood in a vast, empty space, the ground beneath their feet smooth and white, stretching infinitely in all directions. The air was still, heavy with an unnatural calm.  

A voice echoed through the void, soft and familiar.  

“You already know.”  

Avery turned slowly, and there, standing a few feet away, was themselves.  

The other Avery smiled faintly, their black eyes glinting like mirrors.  

“Welcome back.”
