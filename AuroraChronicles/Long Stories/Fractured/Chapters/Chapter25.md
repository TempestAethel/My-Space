## **Chapter 25: Fractured Reality (Part 1)**  

Avery kept walking.  

The gray haze clung to the horizon, stretching endlessly, the barren ground cracking beneath their feet with every step. The world was silent—oppressive and empty, save for the faint pulse thrumming inside their mind. It was soft but constant, like the whisper of something just out of reach.  

“How is this better?” Avery whispered to themselves, their voice hoarse and trembling. “Wasn’t it supposed to end?”  

The question hung in the air, unanswered. The weight of it pressed against their chest, suffocating and relentless. Every step felt heavier than the last, the cracks in the earth growing deeper, the shadows along the edges of the world creeping closer.  

The field, once golden and vibrant, now seemed like a cruel parody of itself—a hollow shell, lifeless and gray.  

*You didn’t fix it.*  

The thought echoed through Avery’s mind, unbidden and sharp, slicing through the fragile quiet they’d clung to. They stopped, their body trembling, their fists clenching at their sides.  

“No,” they muttered, their voice shaking. “I stopped the machine. I stopped the loop. This is supposed to be *over*.”  

*Is it?*  

The pulse in their mind deepened, louder now, vibrating through their skull. Avery staggered forward, clutching their head as the ground trembled beneath them.  

“Stop it,” they hissed through gritted teeth. “Just… stop.”  

But the pulse only grew stronger, and with it came a voice—a faint whisper, layered and distorted, yet achingly familiar.  

*“You can’t run from me, Avery.”*  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. Slowly, they turned, their eyes scanning the empty field.  

And then they saw it.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stood at the edge of the horizon, its figure flickering like a glitch in a broken system. Its black eyes gleamed in the dim light, and its mouth curled into a faint, knowing smile.  

“You again,” Avery said, their voice low and filled with exhaustion. “What do you want from me?”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its movements smooth and inhuman. “I think you already know,” it said, its voice layered with static.  

Avery clenched their fists, anger rising in their chest. “I made my choice,” they snapped. “I stopped the loop. You shouldn’t even exist anymore.”  

The doppelgänger took a slow step forward, its form flickering with each movement. “You stopped the machine,” it said calmly. “But the signal? The loop? That’s not something you can just erase, Avery. It’s not something you can escape.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their hands trembling. “That’s not true. I’m done. I’m *free*.”  

“Free?” The doppelgänger laughed—a hollow, echoing sound that sent shivers down Avery’s spine. “Look around you. Does this look like freedom to you?”  

The field trembled, the shadows creeping closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery like hungry fingers.  

“This is just another version of the loop,” the doppelgänger continued, its voice soft but cutting. “Another cage. You didn’t break anything, Avery. You just rewrote it.”  

Avery took a step back, their chest tightening. “No,” they whispered. “You’re lying.”  

“Am I?” The doppelgänger’s black eyes bore into Avery’s, unblinking. “You thought you could control it. That you could make it better. But all you did was rebuild the trap—and now you’re stuck in it. Just like before.”  

Avery’s legs gave out, and they sank to the ground, their hands clutching their head. The pulse in their mind was deafening now, pounding like a drum, drowning out their thoughts.  

“This isn’t real,” they muttered, their voice trembling. “None of this is real.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its presence overwhelming, suffocating. “Does it matter?” it asked softly. “Whether it’s real or not, you’re still here. You’re still trapped.”  

Avery looked up, tears streaming down their face. “Then what was the point?” they choked out. “Why did I do all of this if it didn’t change anything?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, almost pityingly. “Because you thought you could escape yourself,” it said. “But you can’t. You *are* the loop, Avery. You always have been.”  

The words hit like a physical blow, and Avery’s body trembled, their breath coming in shallow gasps. The shadows surged forward, swirling around them, and the world seemed to tilt, the cracks in the ground widening into chasms.  

The doppelgänger stood, its black eyes glinting as it gazed down at Avery. “There’s only one way out,” it said.  

Avery looked up, their eyes red and filled with despair. “What is it?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, cold and sharp. “Let go.”  

The ground beneath Avery gave way, and they plunged into the void, the shadows consuming them as the pulse in their mind reached a deafening crescendo.

When Avery opened their eyes, they were back in the lab.  

The device stood before them, silent and cold. The console screen flickered faintly, its glow weak but persistent.  

A single line of text appeared on the screen:  

**LOOP RESET.**  

Avery staggered back, their body trembling, their mind racing. “No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening.”  

The lab was pristine, untouched, as though nothing had ever happened. The cracks in the walls were gone, the shadows erased, the light from the device steady and unyielding.  

But it was all wrong.  

The console flickered again, and new words appeared:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at the screen, their chest tightening as the weight of the words sank in.  

“No,” they said, their voice shaking. “I won’t do this again. I can’t.”  

But the device didn’t care. The words on the screen pulsed softly, waiting.  

Avery fell to their knees, their hands clutching their head as the pulse in their mind returned, faint but insistent. The loop wasn’t broken. It had never been broken.  

It had just started over.  

And they were still trapped inside it.

## **Chapter 25: Fractured Reality (Part 2)**  

Avery knelt on the cold floor of the lab, their hands trembling as the words on the console pulsed faintly:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

The hum of the machine was gone, but its absence was just as loud, a suffocating silence that pressed down on Avery’s chest. The weight of the loop—the inescapable truth of it—felt heavier than ever.  

“I made my choice,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I stopped it. I *stopped* it.”  

But the machine, the loop, didn’t care. It waited, patient and unyielding, for Avery to comply.  

“You can’t win,” came a familiar voice, low and distorted.  

Avery turned sharply, their eyes locking onto the figure standing in the corner of the room. The doppelgänger was back, its black eyes empty, its face calm and emotionless.  

“You’ve never been able to win,” it said softly, stepping forward. “The loop isn’t something you can break. It’s part of you now. It always has been.”  

Avery staggered to their feet, anger flaring in their chest. “No,” they snapped, their voice trembling. “You’re wrong. I did everything I was supposed to. I stopped the signal. I chose to move forward.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile playing on its lips. “And yet, here you are. Back where you started.”  

Avery’s fists clenched at their sides, their nails digging into their palms. “I don’t believe you,” they said, their voice rising. “There has to be a way out. There *has* to be.”  

The doppelgänger gestured to the console, its black eyes glinting in the faint glow of the screen. “Go ahead,” it said. “Try again. Press the button. See where it takes you.”  

Avery’s gaze shifted to the console, their heart pounding. The words on the screen pulsed brighter, drawing them in, daring them to make a choice.  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

They took a step back, shaking their head. “No,” they whispered. “I won’t do it. I won’t start the loop again.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, sharp and cold. “Then you’ll stay here forever,” it said. “Trapped in this moment, in this place. A prisoner of your own indecision.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, the pulse in their mind growing louder, more insistent. The walls of the lab seemed to press closer, the air growing heavy with the weight of their despair.  

“There’s another way,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “There has to be.”  

The doppelgänger’s expression darkened, its smile fading. “There is no other way,” it said, its voice harsh and final. “The loop is all there is. You can reset it, or you can rot here. Those are your choices.”  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face. “Why?” they whispered. “Why can’t I escape?”  

The doppelgänger stepped closer, its voice softening. “Because you don’t want to,” it said. “You built the device to escape yourself, to erase everything you couldn’t bear to face. But the truth is, Avery, you don’t want to leave. You don’t want to let go. That’s why the loop exists—because you need it.”  

Avery’s knees buckled, and they sank to the floor, their body trembling. The words on the screen pulsed brighter, faster, as if the machine could sense their hesitation.  

“I can’t,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I can’t do this anymore.”  

“You’ve said that before,” the doppelgänger said, its tone cold. “And yet, here you are. Again. And again. And again.”  

The lab began to flicker, the edges of the room glitching and warping as the cracks in Avery’s mind deepened. The pulse in their head became a roar, drowning out everything else.  

Avery clutched their head, screaming, as the world around them began to collapse.

When they opened their eyes, they were back in the field.  

But it wasn’t the same.  

The golden light was gone, replaced by a dull gray haze that stretched across the horizon. The ground was cracked and barren, the wildflowers withered and lifeless. The air was heavy, suffocating, and the shadows at the edges of the field crept closer with every passing moment.  

Avery stood in the center of it all, their heart pounding, their breath ragged. The field wasn’t real—it never had been—but now it felt even more hollow, like an echo of something that had once mattered but no longer did.  

They turned slowly, their eyes scanning the empty horizon. There was no one else here. No Marcus. No Elise. No Lena.  

They were alone.  

And yet, the pulse in their mind remained, steady and insistent, a constant reminder of what they had become.  

“This can’t be it,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “This can’t be all that’s left.”  

But the field didn’t answer.  

Avery took a step forward, then another, their legs heavy, their body weighed down by the crushing realization of their failure.  

They had tried to break the loop. They had tried to move forward. But in the end, it had all led them back here—to the same emptiness, the same silence, the same crushing sense of futility.  

The shadows crept closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery, pulling at the edges of the field. The pulse in their mind grew louder, almost deafening, as the ground beneath their feet began to crack and shift.  

Avery stopped, their shoulders slumping as the weight of it all pressed down on them. “What do you want from me?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

The shadows didn’t answer.  

The pulse didn’t stop.  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face. “I can’t do this anymore,” they whispered. “I don’t want to do this anymore.”  

But the loop didn’t care.  

When they opened their eyes, the field was gone.  

They were back in the lab.  

And the console screen flickered faintly, displaying the same, unrelenting question:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at it, their breath trembling, their hands hanging limp at their sides.  

And this time, they didn’t answer.
