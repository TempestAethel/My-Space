## **Epilogue: Fractured Reality (Part 1)**  

Avery woke to the sound of birdsong.  

For a moment, they lay still, their body sinking into the warmth of the bed beneath them. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, painting golden streaks across the walls. Everything felt quiet. Still. Normal.  

But it wasn’t.  

Avery sat up slowly, their heart racing as they scanned the room. It was familiar—too familiar. The wooden desk by the window, the stack of books piled neatly in the corner, the faint hum of life outside. This was their apartment. Or at least, it looked like it.  

“Home,” Avery whispered, their voice shaky.  

It didn’t feel real.  

Swinging their legs over the side of the bed, Avery stood and crossed the room, their footsteps hesitant. They reached out and touched the surface of the desk. Solid. Cool. Real.  

But as their fingers brushed the spine of one of the books, a flash of something sharp and fragmented cut through their mind. A memory, or maybe a dream. The lab. The device. The hum.  

Avery pulled their hand back, their chest tightening. “No,” they muttered to themselves. “It’s over. It’s done.”  

They turned toward the window, drawing the curtain aside. Outside, the world stretched out before them—vibrant, alive. The streets below were bustling with people, cars moving lazily through the intersections, the sound of laughter drifting up from somewhere nearby.  

It was perfect. Too perfect.  

Avery’s breath caught as they spotted a woman walking down the street, her back to them. Something about her was achingly familiar—the tilt of her head, the way she moved.  

“Lena?” Avery whispered, their voice trembling.  

Without thinking, they turned and bolted out of the apartment, the door slamming shut behind them. Their feet pounded against the stairs as they descended, each step echoing in their mind. By the time they reached the street, the woman was gone, lost in the crowd.  

Avery spun in place, their chest heaving. “Lena!” they shouted, their voice breaking.  

No one turned. No one reacted. The world carried on as if they didn’t exist.  

Avery staggered to the curb, their hands shaking. “She’s not real,” they whispered to themselves, trying to steady their breathing. “This isn’t real.”  

But the world around them didn’t crack. It didn’t glitch. It remained solid, whole, unyielding.  

They ran a hand through their hair, their mind racing. This was wrong. It all felt wrong. But the more they tried to grasp the edges of what was wrong, the more it slipped through their fingers like sand.  

A soft breeze brushed against their skin, carrying with it a faint, familiar scent—wildflowers. Avery froze, their eyes widening as memories surged forward, unbidden.  

The field. The device. The choice.  

The pulse in their mind returned, faint but insistent, like a second heartbeat. Avery stumbled backward, clutching their head as flashes of the past erupted in their mind. The lab. The shadows. The loop.  

“No,” they whispered, their voice trembling. “Not again. I broke it. I broke the loop.”  

But as they looked up, the world seemed to shift ever so slightly. A crack in the sidewalk shimmered, almost imperceptibly, before sealing itself. A woman walking past paused for a fraction of a second, her face frozen in mid-laugh, before continuing as if nothing had happened.  

Avery’s stomach churned, their breath coming in short, shallow gasps. “This isn’t real,” they muttered, backing away. “This can’t be real.”  

They turned and ran, weaving through the crowd, their mind racing. Every step felt heavier, every sound sharper. The city seemed to blur at the edges, its colors too bright, its movements too smooth.  

And then, they saw it.  

At the end of the street, standing beneath the flickering glow of a streetlamp, was the doppelgänger.  

Avery skidded to a halt, their chest heaving. The figure stood perfectly still, its black eyes locked onto Avery’s, its expression calm and unreadable.  

“You,” Avery hissed, their voice trembling with anger and fear.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint smile tugging at its lips. “Welcome back,” it said softly, its voice layered with static.  

Avery’s fists clenched, their body trembling. “I broke the loop,” they spat. “I made my choice. You’re not supposed to be here.”  

The doppelgänger stepped forward, its movements slow and deliberate. “You did make your choice,” it said. “But that doesn’t mean you escaped. Did you really think it would be that easy?”  

Avery shook their head, tears streaming down their face. “No,” they whispered. “You’re lying. This is real. This is *real.*”  

The doppelgänger stopped a few feet away, its black eyes unblinking. “Is it?”  

The world around them flickered, just for a moment, but it was enough. Avery staggered, their breath catching as the ground beneath them shimmered like the surface of a broken mirror.  

“No,” they whispered, their voice breaking. “This can’t be happening.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, cold and sharp. “You’re still in the loop, Avery. You always have been.”  

The pulse in Avery’s mind grew louder, the pressure building as the world around them began to crack, fragments of light and shadow bleeding together.  

And for the first time, Avery understood the truth.  

They hadn’t escaped.  

They never would.

## **Epilogue: Fractured Reality (Part 2)**  

The world shattered.  

The cracks spread like spiderwebs across the street, splitting open the sky and buildings until fragments of light and shadow bled into one another. Avery stumbled backward, their breath ragged, as the scene around them flickered like a broken reel of film.  

The bustling city melted away, replaced by a dark, infinite void. The hum returned—not loud, but steady, like a pulse vibrating deep in their chest.  

And then, the doppelgänger stepped forward, its black eyes gleaming.  

“You should have known,” it said, its voice layered and cold. “You thought you could escape, but you’ve only taken a different path through the same maze.”  

“No,” Avery said, their voice shaking as they backed away. “This isn’t real. You’re not real.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile tugging at its lips. “Does it matter?” it asked softly. “Real or not, you’re still here. You’re still *trapped.*”  

Avery clutched their head, their mind spinning. The pulse in their mind grew louder, more insistent, as the world around them flickered between the void and fragments of their memories—the field, the lab, Lena’s face.  

“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I broke the loop. I made my choice.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, sharp and cruel. “You made *a* choice,” it said. “But the loop isn’t something you can destroy. It isn’t something you can escape. It’s *you.*”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow, their knees buckling as they collapsed to the ground. Tears streamed down their face as the truth clawed at the edges of their mind, tearing through every illusion they had clung to.  

“It was supposed to be over,” Avery said, their voice cracking. “I was supposed to be free.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its black eyes boring into theirs. “Freedom was never an option,” it said. “You built this. You *are* this. And no matter how many times you try to rewrite it, you’ll always end up here.”  

The void trembled, the pulse in Avery’s mind reaching a deafening crescendo. The fragments of the world around them spun faster, collapsing into a swirling maelstrom of light and shadow.  

“Then what’s the point?” Avery screamed, their voice raw with despair. “Why keep going if it always ends the same way?”  

The doppelgänger leaned closer, its voice a whisper. “Because you can’t stop. You don’t want to. You’ll always come back, Avery. You’ll always start again.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their hands clawing at the ground. “No,” they muttered, their voice trembling. “Not this time. I won’t do it again.”  

The doppelgänger stood, its expression unreadable. “You say that every time.”  

The void rippled, and the ground beneath Avery began to dissolve, pulling them deeper into the darkness. The pulse in their mind grew fainter, softer, as if it were letting go.  

And then—silence.

When Avery opened their eyes, they were standing in the field again.  

The golden light had returned, the wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze. The air was warm, the sky impossibly blue. It was beautiful.  

It was a lie.  

Avery stood still, their body heavy, their heart hollow. They knew this place. They had been here before. Over and over again.  

The wildflowers blurred as tears filled their eyes. “How many times?” they whispered to no one. “How many times have I done this?”  

There was no answer. Only the sound of the wind, soft and indifferent.  

Avery turned, their gaze scanning the endless horizon. In the distance, they saw a figure standing at the edge of the field, its silhouette sharp against the light.  

The doppelgänger.  

It didn’t move. It didn’t speak. It just waited.  

Avery’s chest tightened as they took a step forward, then another, their legs moving as if on their own. They didn’t want to go. They didn’t want to face it. But the pull was too strong, the loop too familiar.  

They stopped a few feet away, their breath trembling.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, its black eyes glinting in the sunlight. “Welcome back,” it said softly.  

Avery’s fists clenched at their sides, their tears falling freely now. “Is there no way out?” they asked, their voice breaking.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its expression unreadable. “That’s up to you,” it said.  

The field trembled, the golden light flickering as cracks began to spread across the ground. Avery looked down, their chest heaving as the world around them began to fall apart once more.  

They turned back to the doppelgänger, their voice raw with desperation. “How do I end this?”  

The doppelgänger smiled again, cold and knowing. “You already know the answer.”  

The cracks widened, the light bleeding into shadow, and the pulse in Avery’s mind returned, steady and unrelenting.  

As the world collapsed around them, Avery closed their eyes, their body trembling.  

And when they opened them, they were back in the lab.  

The console screen flickered, its message burning into their mind:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at the screen, their breath shallow, their hands shaking.  

And this time, they reached out.
