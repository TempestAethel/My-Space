## **Chapter 17: Simulated Lives (Part 1)**  

Avery gasped as they opened their eyes, their body jolting upright as though surfacing from a deep, suffocating ocean. Their lungs burned with the first breath, the world around them blinding in its clarity.  

They weren’t in the field anymore.  

The blue sky and golden light were gone, replaced by an ordinary room—quiet, clean, and unnervingly familiar. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting soft beams across a polished wooden floor.  

Avery blinked, disoriented. Their head throbbed as they took in the surroundings: a modest living room. A couch sat near the far wall, a coffee table covered with neatly stacked books. A faint smell of coffee and fresh air lingered, warm and calming.  

Slowly, Avery pushed themselves to their feet, their limbs heavy and shaky. “Where…?”  

The word barely escaped their lips before they stopped, their heart seizing in their chest.  

A voice carried from the kitchen—a voice Avery hadn’t heard in years.  

“Morning, sleepyhead!”  

Avery froze.  

“No…” They whispered, their body trembling. “It’s not possible.”  

They turned slowly, their heart pounding, and there—standing in the doorway with a coffee mug in hand—was a woman Avery knew far too well.  

It was *her*.  

Dark hair pulled into a loose ponytail, a small scar along her chin that she’d always tried to hide, her smile warm and radiant in the morning light.  

“Lena…” Avery choked out, their voice cracking.  

Lena grinned, her brown eyes sparkling with amusement. “Well, good morning to you too,” she said teasingly. “You’re up late. I was starting to think you’d sleep through the whole day.”  

Avery stumbled back, their chest heaving. “No. You’re not real. You can’t be real.”  

Lena frowned slightly, tilting her head. “What’s gotten into you? Are you feeling okay?”  

Avery’s hands shook as they backed away, the room tilting around them. “This isn’t real. You’re not here. You—”  

*You’re gone.*  

The words lodged in Avery’s throat like broken glass. Memories surged forward—the accident, the grief, the guilt that had driven them to the device in the first place.  

But Lena was here, alive and breathing, looking at Avery with concern in her eyes. “Hey,” she said softly, setting her coffee mug down on the table. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”  

“This is a lie,” Avery whispered, their voice barely audible. “You’re not here. You can’t be.”  

Lena stepped forward cautiously, her expression softening. “Avery, I’m right here. Look at me.”  

Avery couldn’t breathe. Their mind screamed at them to run, to reject this illusion for what it was—but their heart *ached*. They wanted to believe. They *needed* to believe.  

Lena stopped just in front of Avery, her presence warm and real in a way that Avery couldn’t comprehend. “You’ve been working too hard again, haven’t you?” she murmured, reaching out to brush Avery’s arm.  

The touch was soft, familiar. Avery’s knees nearly gave out.  

“It’s not real,” Avery sobbed, clenching their fists as tears burned in their eyes. “You’re dead. I watched you—”  

The memory struck like a hammer: Lena’s broken body, the shattered windshield, blood pooling on the pavement. Avery had held her hand as she whispered her last words.  

And now she was here. Alive. Smiling.  

Lena’s expression didn’t waver. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said softly, her hand lingering on Avery’s arm. “I’m right here. You’re safe. We’re safe.”  

The words—so calm, so soothing—tore through Avery’s resolve like paper. “How can this be happening?” they whispered, their voice breaking.  

Lena smiled faintly, her gaze filled with a quiet sadness. “Maybe it doesn’t matter,” she said. “Maybe it’s better to stop asking.”  

Avery blinked, startled by her words. “What?”  

“Does it feel real?” Lena asked gently.  

Avery’s breath hitched. Did it? The room, Lena’s voice, her touch—it all felt so *real*. More real than anything Avery had felt in the void, in the fractured spaces where reality had broken apart.  

And yet—  

“It’s not real,” Avery said, though the conviction in their voice wavered.  

Lena’s smile faltered, just slightly. “Then why are you still here?”  

The question hit like a punch to the gut. Avery staggered back, the walls around them flickering like a glitching screen. Lena watched them, her expression still soft, but there was something else there now—something *off*.  

“Stop it,” Avery said, their voice rising. “You’re not her. This isn’t real. You’re just another simulation!”  

Lena sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Why do you always do this, Avery? Why do you keep running from what you want?”  

“I’m not running,” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I’m trying to stop this! To fix it!”  

Lena took another step forward, her voice steady but sharp. “You can’t fix what’s already broken.”  

The words froze Avery in place. “What?”  

“Why keep fighting?” Lena said softly, her eyes locking onto Avery’s. “Why can’t you just stay here, with me? We can be happy again. Isn’t that what you want?”  

Avery’s chest ached, the pull of her words like a weight dragging them under water. “This isn’t real,” they whispered again, tears streaming down their face.  

Lena reached out, her touch almost pleading. “It doesn’t have to be real. It just has to *feel* real.”  

The room flickered violently, the walls shaking as though the world itself were starting to come apart. Avery clutched their head, the pressure behind their eyes returning with a vengeance.  

“Stop!” they screamed. “This isn’t real!”  

The hum returned—the device’s hum—loud and consuming, vibrating through the room. Lena’s expression twisted, her smile fading as cracks began to appear along her skin.  

“Avery,” she said, her voice layered and distorted now. “Don’t do this. Don’t leave me again.”  

The walls fractured, light spilling through the cracks like a blinding flood. Lena’s form wavered, her face flickering between sadness and something cold, something *inhuman*.  

Avery fell to their knees, the world around them collapsing. “You’re not her,” they sobbed, their voice a broken whisper.  

Lena’s voice echoed one last time as the light consumed everything.  

“Why can’t you just let me stay?”  

The room shattered.

Avery gasped awake, their body convulsing as they hit the cold, hard floor. They choked on air, their lungs desperate for breath.  

The lab was back—the real lab. The device hummed quietly on the table, its glow faint and steady. The console flickered, its screen blank.  

Avery curled into a ball, tears streaming down their face as they sobbed uncontrollably.  

Lena was gone.  

She had never been here.  

It wasn’t real.  

But for a moment—for just a moment—it had been.  

And that hurt more than anything else.

## **Chapter 17: Simulated Lives (Part 2)**  

Avery’s sobs echoed in the empty lab, the sound ragged and hollow, swallowed by the sterile hum of the machine. Their chest heaved with the weight of it—of grief, of anger, of unbearable loneliness.  

*Why can’t you just let me stay?*  

Lena’s words haunted them, lingering in the cold air like a ghost that refused to fade. Avery wiped at their face with trembling hands, pulling themselves upright. The device pulsed quietly on the table, its glow rhythmic, steady, unrelenting.  

“Why?” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “Why are you doing this to me?”  

The console flickered in response, a line of distorted text appearing across the screen:  

**You already know.**  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, their teeth grinding together. “Stop saying that!” they shouted, slamming a fist against the table. “Stop! Stop—just *tell me!*”  

The machine didn’t answer. The hum continued, soft and indifferent, as if mocking Avery’s desperation.  

They stumbled to their feet, pacing the room like a caged animal. “It’s not real,” they muttered to themselves, their voice unsteady. “None of this is real. Lena, the house… the field—it’s all lies. *It’s all lies.*”  

But even as they said it, doubt gnawed at the edges of their thoughts. The warmth of Lena’s touch. The smell of coffee. The sound of her voice, soft and familiar. For a moment, Avery had felt… safe. Whole.  

And wasn’t that what they wanted?  

They stopped pacing, their eyes falling on the device. Its glow pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat, as though waiting for them to make a decision.  

*It doesn’t have to be real. It just has to feel real.*  

Lena’s words surfaced again, and Avery clenched their fists, their knuckles white. “No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “No. I won’t let you win.”  

The shadows in the corners of the lab seemed to ripple as if reacting to Avery’s defiance. The air grew heavier, pressing down on their chest, and the hum of the machine deepened, vibrating in their bones.  

Then, faintly, Avery heard it.  

A voice.  

*“Avery.”*  

They froze, their blood running cold. It wasn’t Lena’s voice this time—it was deeper, distorted, layered with something *else*.  

“Avery,” the voice repeated, louder now, filling the room. “You can’t keep running.”  

Avery spun around, searching the lab, but it was empty. “Who’s there?” they demanded, their voice shaking. “Show yourself!”  

The console screen blinked to life, text crawling across it like something alive:  

**You let it in. Now it’s time to see.**  

The lights in the lab flickered violently, the shadows stretching and distorting. Avery stumbled back, their head pounding as static hissed in their ears. The hum of the machine grew deafening, the sound twisting into a low, guttural roar.  

“No,” Avery gasped, clutching their head. “Not again. Not again!”  

The walls rippled, and the room around them began to *melt*. The floor warped beneath their feet, the ceiling stretching into darkness. Shapes formed in the shadows—half-seen figures, faces twisted in anguish, reaching hands clawing at the edges of Avery’s vision.  

They staggered back, pressing themselves against the table as the room collapsed around them. “Stop!” they screamed. “Leave me alone!”  

The roar peaked, and the shadows surged forward—consuming the lab, the device, everything. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as the darkness swallowed them whole, the pressure in their skull building until they thought they might shatter.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were somewhere new.  

They stood in a long hallway, its walls cracked and peeling, the air heavy with dust and decay. The floor creaked beneath their feet as they stepped forward, the sound echoing eerily in the silence.  

Avery’s pulse quickened as they glanced around. It was familiar—too familiar.  

“This can’t be happening,” they whispered.  

At the far end of the hallway was a door. A door they knew. A door they remembered.  

The door from the house.  

“No,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “I’m not going back there.”  

But even as they said it, their feet moved forward, drawn toward the door like a moth to a flame. The hallway stretched on forever, the door always just out of reach. Shadows pooled along the edges of the walls, shifting like something alive.  

A voice whispered faintly behind them, soft and mocking.  

*“Why are you still fighting?”*  

Avery ignored it, their breathing shallow as they forced themselves to keep walking.  

*“You don’t have to do this. Just stop, Avery. Let go.”*  

The voice was Lena’s this time, clear and soothing, and Avery’s steps faltered. They turned sharply, their heart pounding.  

Lena stood in the middle of the hallway, her figure glowing faintly in the dim light. Her face was calm, her expression gentle.  

“Come back,” she said softly. “You don’t have to keep hurting yourself like this.”  

Avery shook their head, their voice cracking. “You’re not real. You’re not her.”  

Lena’s smile wavered, the light around her flickering. “Does that matter?” she whispered. “What’s real doesn’t have to hurt. You could be happy here, Avery. With me.”  

Avery clenched their fists, tears stinging their eyes. “Stop it!”  

“You’re breaking yourself apart,” Lena said, her voice growing distant, layered with static. “Why keep running?”  

The shadows surged from the walls, crawling toward Avery like dark tendrils. The hallway trembled violently, the floor cracking and splintering beneath their feet.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed, stumbling back. “Get away from me!”  

Lena’s figure shattered like glass, her voice echoing as the shadows swallowed everything.  

*“Why won’t you let me stay?”*  

The floor gave way beneath Avery, and they fell into darkness.  

---

Avery hit the ground hard, the impact jarring through their body. Gasping, they pushed themselves upright, their vision blurred and disoriented.  

They were back in the lab again—or at least, what *looked* like the lab. The walls flickered in and out of focus, pieces of the room missing, replaced by empty voids.  

The console screen glowed faintly in the darkness, a single message waiting for them.  

**Who are you?**  

Avery stared at the words, their chest tightening as the question repeated in their mind like a drumbeat.  

*Who are you?*  

They didn’t know anymore.  

Their memories felt fractured, incomplete—reality slipping further from their grasp with every passing moment.  

Avery sank to the floor, their head in their hands. “Who am I?” they whispered, tears streaming down their face.  

The shadows lingered at the edges of the room, watching, waiting.  

And from the darkness, the voice came again.  

*“Remember.”*
