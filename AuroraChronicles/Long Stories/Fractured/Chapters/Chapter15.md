## **Chapter 15: The Puppet Strings (Part 1)**  

The door closed behind Avery with a soft click, the sound far louder in the silence that swallowed them whole. The field, the wind, the golden light—it was gone.  

They stood at the threshold of the house, staring into absolute darkness. The air was still, heavy with an almost tangible weight, like they had stepped into a void where time itself had stopped.  

*“Come inside,”* the child’s voice echoed again, soft and melodic, pulling Avery deeper into the dark.  

Avery hesitated, their body trembling with every shallow breath. “Where are you?” their voice cracked, hoarse from fear and exhaustion.  

Silence answered.  

The only thing visible was the faint outline of a hallway stretching ahead, lit by a dull, flickering light. The walls were familiar—faded wallpaper, peeling at the edges, like a home forgotten and left to decay. Avery’s steps were slow and cautious as they moved forward, the floor creaking beneath their weight.  

With each step, Avery felt it: the sensation of being watched. Eyes they couldn’t see lingered on their back, heavy and unrelenting. They glanced over their shoulder, but there was nothing—only the door they had entered through, now impossibly far away, as though the house itself were stretching around them.  

A shadow moved ahead.  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. For a heartbeat, the hallway flickered as though seen through a broken screen. A figure stood at the far end—small, hunched, and motionless.  

“Who’s there?” Avery whispered.  

The figure didn’t move.  

Avery’s pulse thundered in their ears as they stepped closer, drawn toward the shape despite every instinct screaming at them to turn back. The dim light sharpened its outline—a child, standing still with their back turned, facing a door at the end of the hallway.  

A memory, sharp and sudden, pushed its way into Avery’s mind.  

*That door. That figure.*  

They had been here before.  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head. “This can’t be happening.”  

The child shifted slightly, their shoulders rising and falling with slow, deliberate breaths. The sound of laughter—soft, echoing, and far too familiar—filled the hallway, sending icy tendrils of dread curling through Avery’s chest.  

The child turned.  

It was Avery.  

A younger version of themselves—no older than ten—dressed in a worn, oversized sweater and scuffed shoes. Their face was pale, their eyes wide and glassy, but their mouth curled into a small, unnatural smile.  

“Hi, Avery,” the child said softly, their voice clear and cold, cutting through the stillness like a blade.  

Avery staggered back, shaking uncontrollably. “No. You’re not real.”  

The child cocked their head to the side, the smile never wavering. “You don’t remember, do you?”  

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Avery choked out, their voice barely audible.  

“You do,” the child replied, their tone singsong and cruel. “You just don’t want to.”  

The hallway flickered again, the walls warping and twisting like they were alive. The child’s form shimmered with it, their edges blurring, their glassy eyes fixed on Avery.  

“You opened the door,” the child whispered, their voice layered now—more than one voice speaking in unison. “You let it out.”  

Avery pressed their hands to their head, the pressure building behind their eyes. “Stop!”  

The house seemed to respond. The walls groaned and stretched, the wallpaper peeling back like rotting skin. The floorboards buckled beneath Avery’s feet as though something enormous was shifting just below the surface.  

“You let it in,” the child continued, their voice rising. “You let it inside you, and now it’s everywhere. It’s you, Avery. It’s all you.”  

The shadows at the edges of the hallway crawled closer, tendrils of darkness reaching for Avery, pulling at their feet, their legs, their mind.  

“Please,” Avery begged, their voice breaking. “Stop. I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know.”  

The child stepped closer, their smile widening, the glassy blackness of their eyes swallowing what remained of their face. “But you did. And now you’re going to remember everything.”  

The shadows surged forward. Avery felt them wrap around their body, dragging them down, suffocating them in cold, unrelenting darkness.  

And then—  

---  

Avery woke with a gasp, their body jerking upright.  

They were back in the lab.  

The harsh fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flickering slightly, their glow cold and unfeeling. The air smelled of metal and antiseptic. Avery’s heart pounded, their shirt soaked through with sweat.  

For a long moment, they sat there, gasping for breath, their mind spinning. It had felt real. *Too real.*  

But it wasn’t. It couldn’t have been.  

A voice broke the silence. “Avery.”  

Avery flinched, their head snapping toward the sound. Marcus stood at the edge of the lab, his face drawn and tired, his dark eyes fixed on Avery with a mixture of relief and wariness.  

“You’re awake,” Marcus said quietly.  

Avery stared at him, disoriented. “Where… where am I?”  

“You’re back in the lab,” Marcus replied, stepping closer. “We found you collapsed outside the facility. You’ve been out for hours.”  

Avery ran a trembling hand through their hair, trying to process. “The house,” they whispered. “The child… It was me. It said—”  

“Hey,” Marcus interrupted sharply, crouching down so he was eye-level with Avery. “Focus. Whatever you saw, it wasn’t real. Do you hear me? The signal’s messing with your head.”  

Avery shook their head, their vision swimming. “No. It’s real. It’s always been real. I opened the door, Marcus. I let it out.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened. “What door, Avery? What are you talking about?”  

Avery looked at him, tears welling in their eyes. “The device. It’s not just erasing memories—it’s taking something else. Pieces of us. Fracturing reality. And it’s inside me, Marcus. It’s always been inside me.”  

Marcus grabbed Avery’s shoulders, his grip firm but steady. “Listen to me. Whatever this is—whatever the device is doing—it can be stopped. We can stop it. But you need to keep it together, Avery. Don’t let it win.”  

Avery stared at him, searching his face for something—*anything*—to hold onto. Marcus’s expression was hard, determined, but there was something in his eyes that Avery couldn’t quite place.  

“Why are you here, Marcus?” Avery whispered suddenly. “Why did you come back?”  

Marcus’s gaze flickered, just for a second, but the hesitation was there. “Because you need me.”  

Avery frowned, their chest tightening. “That’s not an answer.”  

Marcus stood abruptly, turning toward the console. “We don’t have time for this. The Corporation knows what’s happening. If we don’t act now, they’ll bury this—and us—before we can stop it.”  

Avery’s head spun as they watched Marcus move toward the console. The words of the child echoed in their mind. *You let it out. It’s all you.*  

“Marcus,” Avery said weakly, their voice trembling. “What if we can’t stop it?”  

Marcus paused, his back to Avery. “Then we don’t walk away.”  

The screen on the console flickered to life. Avery stared at it, their pulse quickening as familiar text appeared:  

**Welcome back, Avery.**  

And beneath it, a new line of text blinked slowly:  

**The truth is waiting.**

The words on the screen—**The truth is waiting**—seemed to pulse in time with Avery’s heartbeat. They couldn’t tear their gaze away, as though the message were a living thing pulling them closer, deeper.  

Marcus stood beside the console, his hand hovering over the controls. “Avery, focus.”  

Avery blinked hard, their thoughts scattered, the child’s voice still echoing in their mind. *You let it out. It’s all you.*  

“Marcus…” Avery swallowed hard, struggling to steady their voice. “The device. It’s not just corrupting memories, is it? It’s breaking something deeper. *Us.*”  

Marcus froze. For a heartbeat, he said nothing, his face unreadable. Then, slowly, he turned to look at Avery.  

“Why are you saying that?” His voice was low, cautious, like he was speaking to someone unstable.  

“Because I can feel it,” Avery replied, pushing themselves shakily to their feet. “It’s inside me. It’s rewriting everything—who I am, what’s real. I opened the door, Marcus, and now…”  

Marcus’s gaze hardened. “Now you’re letting it win. That’s what it wants. To break you.”  

Avery took a step back. “You’re not listening. I saw it. I saw myself, Marcus. It told me the truth. The device isn’t just erasing memories—it’s replacing them. Fracturing reality. Turning us into something… else.”  

Marcus let out a sharp breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re losing it, Avery. You’ve been exposed to the signal for too long. That’s why the lines are blurring. That’s why you’re seeing things that aren’t there.”  

“They’re real,” Avery insisted, their voice rising. “You know they’re real, don’t you? You’ve seen it too. The glitches. The *shadows*. The pieces that don’t fit.”  

Marcus turned back to the console abruptly, avoiding Avery’s gaze. “We don’t have time for this.”  

“Marcus!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “Why won’t you answer me? What aren’t you telling me?”  

Marcus’s shoulders tensed, but he didn’t turn around. “You don’t want the truth, Avery. Trust me.”  

“Yes, I do!” Avery snapped. “I need to know. I need to understand what’s happening to me.”  

The hum of the device grew louder, vibrating through the floor like a heartbeat. The console screen flickered again, new words replacing the old ones.  

**HE KNOWS.**  

Avery’s blood ran cold. “Marcus…”  

Marcus turned slowly, his face pale, his dark eyes shadowed by something Avery couldn’t name. “Don’t listen to it.”  

The screen blinked again:  

**HE LIED TO YOU.**  

Avery staggered back, their breath quickening. “What is it talking about?”  

“Nothing,” Marcus said quickly, his voice sharp. “It’s trying to manipulate you.”  

“You knew,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “You knew what the device was doing. You knew, and you didn’t stop it.”  

Marcus stepped toward Avery, his hands raised as though calming a wild animal. “Avery, listen to me—”  

“Don’t!” Avery shouted, backing away. “How long have you known? How much of this is *your fault*?”  

The screen’s glow grew brighter, the words flashing more urgently.  

**HE WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING.**  

Avery stared at Marcus, horror dawning on their face. “You were there,” they said, their voice almost a whisper. “You were part of it.”  

Marcus’s expression faltered, the mask he wore cracking just enough to let something darker bleed through. “It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.”  

Avery’s mind reeled. “You knew what this device could do. You knew what it would become.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened. “I didn’t have a choice.”  

“You *always* had a choice!” Avery shouted. “You could have stopped this. You could have warned me!”  

“It’s bigger than you,” Marcus snapped, his voice hard now, almost cruel. “Bigger than me. You think you’re the only one who’s been used? The Corporation has been pulling the strings from the start. You and I are both pawns in their game.”  

Avery stared at him, their chest heaving. “You lied to me.”  

Marcus took a step closer, his voice softening. “I tried to protect you. But it’s too late now. You’ve seen too much. It’s inside you, Avery. Just like it’s inside me.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow. “Inside you?”  

Marcus nodded slowly, his eyes dark and unreadable. “The signal. The glitches. We’re infected, Avery. You can’t undo it.”  

Avery shook their head, stumbling back. “No. You’re lying.”  

“I wish I were,” Marcus said quietly. “But you felt it, didn’t you? The way reality shifts. The way it pulls at you.”  

Avery’s legs felt weak, the room spinning around them. “It’s not too late,” they whispered, more to themselves than to Marcus. “We can still stop it.”  

Marcus’s face darkened. “Stop it? You don’t even know what *it* is. The device isn’t broken, Avery. It’s doing exactly what it was designed to do.”  

A chill crawled through Avery’s body, their hands shaking uncontrollably. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus looked at them, his expression unreadable. “You’ll see soon enough.”  

The console buzzed loudly, and the screen’s glow intensified, casting long, jagged shadows across the room. The hum of the device grew deafening, like a roar building deep within the earth. Avery clutched their head, the pressure behind their eyes spiking like needles.  

“Make it stop!” Avery screamed.  

Marcus didn’t move. He stood perfectly still, watching as the room distorted around them, the edges of the lab rippling like a mirage.  

The screen flashed again, its message a single command:  

**REMEMBER.**  

The hum reached its peak, and Avery’s vision blurred. They staggered forward, their knees buckling as images flooded their mind—fractured, fragmented, and impossible to piece together.  

A woman’s voice—Elise’s voice—screaming.  

The sound of glass shattering.  

The figure of the child, standing in the doorway.  

The console, flashing red warnings.  

And Marcus, standing beside them, watching it all.  

“No!” Avery sobbed, their voice breaking. “No, no, no!”  

The light from the screen flared violently, blinding them. Avery fell to the floor, their hands pressed to their head as the device’s hum vibrated through their entire body.  

“You let it in,” Marcus’s voice whispered through the chaos.  

And then—  

Silence.  

When Avery opened their eyes, they were alone.  

The lab was gone.  

They stood in the center of an endless, empty void, the darkness stretching infinitely in all directions. A single, faint hum lingered in the air, like a heartbeat at the edge of hearing.  

Ahead of them, a figure appeared.  

It was Avery.  

The doppelgänger smiled, its black eyes glinting.  

“Now you understand,” it said softly.  

The darkness closed in.
