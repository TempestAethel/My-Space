## **Chapter 3: Marcus Returns (Part 1)**  

The morning light filtering through the blinds felt harsh, almost intrusive. Avery rubbed their temples, their head heavy from a restless night. The dreams—or were they memories?—had lingered, vivid and suffocating. Each time they woke, it was as if something had been ripped away, leaving only fragments of emotions they couldn’t name.  

They sat at Elise’s kitchen counter, nursing a cup of bitter coffee that did little to cut through the fog in their mind. The portable drive sat on the table between them, a small, unassuming object that seemed to radiate an unbearable weight.  

“Did you sleep at all?” Elise asked, stepping into the kitchen, already dressed in her usual crisp, no-nonsense attire.  

“Does it matter?” Avery muttered, swirling the dregs of their coffee.  

Elise’s frown deepened, but she didn’t press the issue. Instead, she gestured to the drive. “We’ll start analyzing it in the lab in an hour. Whatever that signal was, it’s not going to unravel itself.”  

Avery nodded but said nothing. The air between them felt thick, weighed down by everything that had happened in the last 48 hours.  

Before either of them could speak again, there was a knock at the door—three sharp, deliberate taps.  

Elise froze, her brow furrowing as she glanced toward the door. “I’m not expecting anyone,” she said quietly.  

Avery’s stomach twisted. The knock came again, louder this time.  

“I’ll get it,” Elise said, moving toward the door.  

Avery stood as well, tension coiling in their chest. They couldn’t explain it, but something about the knock felt wrong, as if it carried an unspoken warning.  

Elise opened the door cautiously, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.  

Then Avery heard the voice—a voice they hadn’t heard in years.  

“Nice place,” Marcus Hale said, leaning casually against the doorframe. His sharp green eyes flicked past Elise to land directly on Avery. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips, but there was no warmth in it. “Hello, Avery. Long time, no see.”  

Avery felt their breath catch, a flood of emotions rushing through them at the sight of him. Marcus hadn’t changed much—same tousled dark hair, same confident swagger—but there was a sharpness to him now, something colder lurking beneath his easy demeanor.  

“What are you doing here, Marcus?” Avery asked, their voice harsher than they intended.  

Marcus raised an eyebrow, pushing past Elise into the apartment without waiting for an invitation. “That’s quite the welcome. Glad to see you’re still as friendly as ever.”  

“Marcus—” Elise started, but he cut her off with a wave of his hand.  

“Relax, Elise. I’m not here to cause trouble. Quite the opposite, actually,” he said, turning to face Avery. “I came to warn you.”  

“Warn me about what?” Avery demanded, crossing their arms.  

Marcus’s smirk faded, replaced by a more serious expression. “About the Corporation. About what they’re really doing with your little toy.”  

Avery felt a chill run down their spine. “You don’t know anything about it.”  

“Don’t I?” Marcus countered, stepping closer. “I was there at the beginning, remember? Before I walked away. Before I realized what they were planning.”  

Elise shut the door behind him, her expression guarded. “Marcus, if you’re here to stir up trouble—”  

“I’m not,” Marcus said sharply, his gaze never leaving Avery. “I’m here because you need to know what you’re up against. The Corporation isn’t just funding your research, Avery—they’re hijacking it. Twisting it into something far worse than you can imagine.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened, their mind racing. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus reached into his jacket and pulled out a small black device, about the size of a thumb drive. He held it up for them to see.  

“This,” he said, his voice low. “This is what they’re using your technology for. Memory replication, manipulation, full-scale mind control. And it’s already operational.”  

Avery stared at the device, their stomach churning. “That’s not possible. The MERI Device isn’t designed for that—it’s not capable of—”  

“You think that matters?” Marcus interrupted, his voice rising. “You think they care about what it’s ‘designed’ for? They’ve taken your work and turned it into a weapon. And you’re the one who handed it to them on a silver platter.”  

“That’s enough,” Elise snapped, stepping between them. Her eyes blazed with anger. “You don’t get to come in here and make accusations without proof, Marcus.”  

“Proof?” Marcus’s smirk returned, though it was colder now. “You want proof? Fine. Run your little anomaly data through this,” he said, tossing the device onto the table. “See what you find.”  

Avery hesitated, their gaze shifting between Marcus and the drive.  

“Why are you even here, Marcus?” Avery asked finally. “Why now?”  

“Because you’re in over your head,” Marcus said simply. “And because if you don’t figure out what’s really going on, you’re going to end up dead—or worse.”  

The room fell into a tense silence. Elise’s jaw was tight, her hands clenched at her sides. Avery felt a dozen questions bubbling to the surface, but none of them would come out.  

Finally, Marcus broke the silence. “I’ll be in touch,” he said, turning toward the door. He paused just before leaving, glancing back over his shoulder. “And Avery? Don’t trust anyone. Not even yourself.”  

With that, he was gone, leaving the door swinging shut behind him.

For a long moment, neither Avery nor Elise spoke.  

“He’s lying,” Elise said finally, though her voice lacked conviction. “He’s just trying to manipulate you.”  

“Maybe,” Avery murmured, their eyes fixed on the black device Marcus had left behind. “But what if he’s not?”  

Elise didn’t respond.  

Avery reached for the device, their hand trembling slightly. Whatever Marcus was playing at, they needed answers—and this felt like the only place to start.

## **Chapter 3: Marcus Returns (Part 2)**  

Avery’s hands hovered over the black device Marcus had left behind. It looked innocuous—just another piece of tech. But it pulsed with the weight of the warning Marcus had delivered. *Memory replication. Manipulation. Full-scale mind control.* Words that sounded impossible, but after what had happened with the MERI Device, Avery wasn’t so sure anymore.

“You’re not seriously thinking of plugging that thing in?” Elise’s voice was sharp, cutting through the heavy silence. She stood across the room, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.  

“Don’t you want to know the truth?” Avery shot back, their gaze never leaving the device.  

“I want to know what Marcus’s game is,” Elise said, her tone cold. “You can’t trust him. He’s been gone for years—where’s he been, and why now? Why show up out of the blue with answers conveniently wrapped up in a neat little package?”  

Avery looked up, irritation bubbling beneath the surface. “You think I trust him? I don’t. But what if he’s right? What if the Corporation is using the device for something darker than we thought?”  

Elise exhaled sharply, uncrossing her arms. “And what if this is a trap? What if that thing wipes out our systems or infects everything with malware?”  

“It’s a risk I have to take,” Avery said, determination overriding their hesitation. “You saw the screen at the lab. You saw what happened. Something’s wrong, Elise. And Marcus might have just given us the key to understanding it.”  

Elise stared at Avery for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Finally, she sighed and walked to the other side of the table, leaning forward with her palms flat on the surface. “Fine. But we do this on my terms. We isolate it—no network access, no power connections it can use to spread. Understood?”  

Avery nodded. “Understood.”

An hour later, they were back in Elise’s lab, a smaller, secured facility separate from the main research center. Elise had always kept it off-grid for her private work—an insurance policy, she called it. The walls were lined with monitors and equipment, all powered by an isolated energy supply. If Marcus’s device did turn out to be a trap, at least it wouldn’t spread beyond these walls.  

“Systems are isolated,” Elise said as she set up a partitioned drive on one of her monitors. “We’ll analyze this thing in a sandbox environment. No direct access to any of our files.”  

Avery sat at the terminal, the small black device in their hand. For a moment, they hesitated, their thoughts racing. Marcus’s voice echoed in their mind: *They’re hijacking it. Twisting it into something far worse than you can imagine.*  

Shaking off the unease, Avery plugged the device into the console. The screen blinked to life, lines of code scrolling too quickly to read. Elise hovered nearby, her expression tense as the data began to flow.  

“Anything?” Avery asked, their voice tight.  

“Nothing yet,” Elise muttered, typing commands to slow the stream of information. “It’s encrypted, but it’s starting to unpack itself.”  

Avery stared at the screen, trying to make sense of the patterns emerging from the code. At first, it was meaningless—just fragments of data, broken and chaotic. But then the patterns started to organize themselves.  

Letters. Words.  

“It’s the same signal,” Avery whispered, leaning closer. “The one from the MERI Device.”  

Elise didn’t respond immediately, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she analyzed the data. “It’s not just similar—it’s identical. Whatever Marcus gave us, it’s tied directly to the anomaly in your experiment.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened. “How? How could he have this?”  

Elise shook her head, her brow furrowed. “I don’t know. But look at this—” She highlighted a section of the code, isolating a sequence that pulsed faintly on the screen. “It’s… adapting. This isn’t just data. It’s active.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “Active? You mean it’s—”  

“Alive,” Elise finished, her voice barely above a whisper.  

The lights in the lab flickered. Avery’s stomach dropped.  

“What was that?” Avery asked, glancing around.  

“System integrity is still stable,” Elise said, though her voice wavered slightly. She checked her monitors, scanning for anomalies. “It could just be a power fluctuation—”  

Before she could finish, the screen froze. The lines of code vanished, replaced by a single sentence that burned across the monitor:  

*WHY DID YOU COME BACK?*  

Avery’s chest tightened. Their mind raced as they stared at the words, cold and deliberate.  

“It’s not possible,” Elise murmured, her voice barely audible.  

Avery pushed back from the console, their pulse pounding in their ears. “Is this… a message?”  

The screen flickered violently, and another sentence appeared:  

*YOU SHOULDN’T BE HERE.*  

The lights overhead dimmed further, plunging the lab into half-shadow. The hum of the equipment grew louder, almost vibrating in the walls.  

“Shut it down,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “Elise, shut it down now.”  

“I’m trying,” Elise said, her fingers moving frantically across the keyboard. “It’s not responding—”  

The screen glitched again, and for a split second, an image appeared. Avery’s heart stopped.  

It was the lab. Their lab. But something was wrong—the walls seemed distorted, as if they were melting into shadow. And in the center of the image was a figure.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. The figure was faceless, its outline human but void of any features. It stood motionless, as though staring directly at them through the screen.  

Then the screen went black.  

The hum of the equipment stopped. The lab fell into an eerie silence, broken only by Avery’s shallow breaths.  

Elise sat frozen, her face pale as she stared at the dark monitor. “What the hell was that?” she whispered.  

Avery couldn’t answer. They felt as though they were being watched, the lingering presence of the faceless figure still prickling at the edges of their mind.  

Finally, Elise spoke again, her voice hoarse. “Marcus was right. Whatever this is… it’s not just data. It’s something else. And it knows we’re here.”  

Avery swallowed hard, the weight of the truth settling over them like a stone. Whatever had infected the MERI Device, whatever Marcus had uncovered—it wasn’t just technology. It was alive.  

And it was watching.
