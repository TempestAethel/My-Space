## **Chapter 5: Escape and Illusion (Part 1)**  

The elevator plunged into darkness, a mechanical groan vibrating through the walls as the descent ground to a halt. Avery’s breath caught. In the pitch black, every sound magnified—Elise’s panicked breathing, Marcus shifting nervously, the faint hum of machinery somewhere deep below.  

*Not again,* Avery thought, a wave of nausea rolling over them.  

“Marcus,” Elise’s voice was sharp, on the edge of breaking. “What’s happening? Why did it stop?”  

“Power flux,” Marcus replied, though even he didn’t sound convinced. “It’s part of the system resetting. We need to move before—”  

The lights flickered on—dim, cold fluorescents—and the elevator jolted back to life, but instead of descending, it rose.  

Marcus cursed under his breath.  

“What’s wrong?” Avery asked, watching the floor numbers tick upward. 4… 5… 6…  

“We’re going the wrong way.” Marcus wiped a hand over his face, his movements frantic. “This isn’t us—this is *it*. The signal. It’s redirecting us.”  

Elise slammed her fist against the control panel, her voice rising. “Then stop it! Shut it down!”  

“I can’t!” Marcus snapped back. “It’s overriding the system. We’re not in control anymore.”  

The elevator came to a sudden stop, the floor indicator frozen at **12**. The doors slid open with a hiss.  

Beyond the threshold stretched a long, unfamiliar hallway bathed in sickly yellow light. The air was thick, heavy, and the silence seemed to breathe, as though the space itself were alive.  

“Where the hell are we?” Elise muttered, peering out cautiously.  

“This isn’t the twelfth floor,” Marcus said quietly.  

Avery didn’t need Marcus to tell them that. Something about the hallway was *wrong*. The walls rippled slightly when they looked too long, like heat waves distorting the edges of a road. It didn’t feel like a real place.  

Elise turned back to Marcus. “We’re not getting back in the elevator, are we?”  

“No,” Marcus said. “We have to keep moving. Staying still gives it time to… adjust.”  

“Adjust?” Avery echoed. “Adjust to *what*?”  

“To *us*,” Marcus replied darkly. “It’s learning, Avery. Adapting.”  

A chill crept up Avery’s spine, but they didn’t argue.  

Marcus stepped cautiously into the hallway, motioning for them to follow. Avery exchanged a wary glance with Elise, then moved forward, the hairs on the back of their neck prickling with each step.  

The hallway seemed to stretch longer the farther they walked. The hum of unseen lights buzzed louder, more erratic, vibrating in their bones. There were doors lining the corridor, spaced far apart. Each was identical—plain steel with no labels, no handles.  

Avery paused at one of them, curiosity gnawing at their fraying resolve. They reached out, their fingertips grazing the cold metal.  

“Don’t.” Marcus’s voice cut sharply through the air.  

Avery froze, snapping their head toward him. “Why?”  

Marcus looked back, his face pale and drawn. “Those doors don’t lead anywhere you want to go.”  

Before Avery could ask what he meant, Elise grabbed their arm, pulling them forward. “We’re wasting time.”  

Reluctantly, Avery let her pull them along.  

The hallway seemed endless. Minutes stretched into something unmeasurable, the buzzing growing louder, the shadows in the corners deepening. Avery’s footsteps felt heavier with each stride, as though the ground were dragging them down.  

Then, abruptly, Marcus stopped.  

“Here,” he said, pointing to an unmarked door that looked no different than the others.  

“What’s here?” Elise asked, suspicion lacing her voice.  

“An exit.” Marcus knelt, prying open a small panel on the wall beside the door and revealing a bundle of wires. “This one isn’t part of the signal yet. It’ll take us out of the loop, at least for a while.”  

Avery stared at him. “How do you know that?”  

Marcus didn’t look up from the panel. “Because I’ve been here before.”  

Elise stepped back, her voice wary. “What do you mean, you’ve been here before?”  

Marcus paused, his shoulders stiffening, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he yanked out a handful of wires, sparks flaring. The door shuddered, then slid open with a groan.  

Beyond it was darkness.  

Avery peered into the void, their heart hammering. “What’s on the other side?”  

Marcus stood, wiping his hands on his shirt. “A chance.”  

“That’s not an answer,” Elise shot back.  

“It’s the only one you’re getting.” Marcus gestured toward the dark doorway. “We don’t have much time. You can stay here and let the signal find you, or you can trust me and go through.”  

Avery hesitated, staring into the inky blackness. It looked like the kind of darkness that swallowed you whole, where light—or people—didn’t come back out.  

They glanced at Elise, whose jaw was clenched tight. “This feels like a trap,” she muttered.  

“Does it matter?” Avery said quietly. “We can’t stay here.”  

Before Elise could respond, Marcus stepped through the doorway and disappeared into the dark.  

Avery swallowed hard, their pulse thudding in their ears. Every instinct screamed at them to turn back. But back to *what*? The loop? The faceless figure? The version of themselves with hollow eyes?  

Taking a deep breath, Avery stepped through the doorway.  

The darkness closed in like icy water. For a second, they were completely blind, their feet unsure of what they stood on—if they stood on anything at all.  

Then they felt Elise’s hand grab their arm, her grip a lifeline. “Avery?” she whispered, her voice small.  

“I’m here,” Avery said, though the words sounded muffled, distorted.  

Suddenly, light flared—blinding and cold.  

Avery squinted, shielding their eyes as their surroundings came into focus.  

They were standing in the middle of the lab again.  

The same lab.  

The same equipment.  

The same terminal.  

Elise let go of Avery’s arm, looking around with wide eyes. “No. No, no, no—this isn’t right.”  

Marcus was gone.  

Avery took a step forward, their head spinning. “How—how did we end up back here?”  

Elise backed up, panic flashing in her eyes. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”  

The screen on the terminal flickered to life.  

A familiar sentence appeared in jagged, white letters:  

**You shouldn’t be here.**  

Avery’s stomach dropped.  

The lights flickered violently, casting jagged shadows across the walls. The sound of footsteps echoed behind them—slow, deliberate, growing closer.  

Avery turned, their breath catching.  

The faceless figure stood at the far end of the lab.  

It was closer this time.  

And it was waiting.

## **Chapter 5: Escape and Illusion (Part 2)**  

Avery couldn’t breathe.  

The faceless figure stood at the far end of the lab, still and silent. Its presence was suffocating—an unnatural void that seemed to warp the space around it. Shadows stretched toward Avery, as if the figure itself were pulling the light from the room.  

Elise’s voice cracked through the haze. “Avery… *move.*”  

The figure took a step forward.  

The sound it made—a low scraping, like metal dragged across concrete—sent a cold spike of terror through Avery’s chest. Their body refused to move, every muscle locked tight, as though the signal itself had coiled around them.  

*Step back. Move.* The thoughts screamed in Avery’s head, but their feet were rooted to the spot.  

The figure took another step. Closer now.  

“Damn it, Avery!” Elise grabbed their arm, yanking hard enough to break their paralysis. “We need to go!”  

The jolt snapped Avery into motion. Together, they stumbled toward the lab door. Elise slammed her hand against the emergency override panel, and the door hissed open painfully slow.  

Avery glanced back.  

The figure was still moving—deliberate, patient. It didn’t need to rush. It knew they couldn’t escape.  

“Come *on!*” Elise shouted, pulling Avery through the doorway and into the corridor.  

The door slid shut behind them with a final, mechanical groan. The hum of the lab equipment was replaced by a cold, suffocating silence.  

They ran.  

The corridor stretched endlessly before them—just like before, the same unmarked steel doors on either side. Avery’s legs burned, but they didn’t dare slow down. Elise ran just ahead, her breathing sharp and ragged.  

“How—how are we back here?” Avery gasped. “We were—”  

“I don’t know!” Elise cut in. “None of this makes sense. Just keep running!”  

Avery’s vision blurred as they sprinted. The hallway seemed to ripple around them, the walls twisting and folding in ways that made Avery’s head spin. The sound of footsteps—the faceless figure’s—echoed behind them, impossibly slow, yet impossibly close.  

*It’s not real.* Avery tried to convince themselves. *It’s the signal. It’s in my head.*  

A sharp *clang* echoed through the hallway—followed by a familiar voice.  

“Stop.”  

Elise skidded to a halt, nearly crashing into Avery.  

The voice came again, steady, calm, and chillingly familiar.  

“Stop running, Avery.”  

Avery turned toward the sound, their stomach plummeting.  

Standing in the middle of the corridor was *Avery*.  

Or something that looked like Avery.  

It was the same as before: their face, their body, but the eyes—those endless, black pits—were worse up close. The other Avery smiled, lips curling into an expression that didn’t belong on their face.  

“Where do you think you’re going?” the doppelgänger asked softly.  

Elise stepped back, grabbing Avery’s wrist. “Avery, don’t listen. Let’s go—”  

“Why run?” The other Avery tilted its head, its voice shifting—distorted and layered, as if multiple people were speaking through it. “You’ll end up back here anyway. You always do.”  

Avery’s chest tightened. “You’re lying.”  

The other Avery’s smile widened, and the black void of its eyes seemed to pulse. “Am I?”  

The corridor around them rippled violently, and Avery felt the floor shift under their feet, as though reality itself were buckling. Elise swore and pulled Avery away, sprinting in the opposite direction.  

They ran blindly, the hallway distorting with every step. The walls stretched and twisted like melting plastic, doors disappearing and reappearing. Avery could hear the other Avery’s voice—soft, mocking—whispering directly into their ear, though they were still running.  

“You can’t escape me, Avery.”  

The words seeped into their mind, burrowing deep. Avery stumbled, their balance faltering. Elise caught them, yanking them forward.  

“Focus!” Elise shouted. “We’re almost—”  

A door appeared suddenly at the end of the hallway. Unlike the others, this one wasn’t steel. It was wooden—familiar, somehow—though Avery couldn’t remember why.  

Elise didn’t hesitate. She threw her shoulder against it, and the door burst open, revealing blinding white light.  

“Go!” Elise yelled.  

Avery hesitated for a fraction of a second, glancing back down the corridor. The other Avery was gone. The faceless figure was gone.  

But the hallway itself was darkening, collapsing, like a tunnel caving in.  

Avery turned and dove through the doorway.  

---

The white light burned through Avery’s vision. For a moment, they felt weightless, as though falling through endless space. Then their body hit solid ground, and everything snapped back into focus.  

They were in a house.  

Avery pushed themselves up onto their hands and knees, gasping for breath. The air was heavy with the scent of something faintly floral, and the silence was deep—unnaturally so.  

“Avery?” Elise’s voice came softly from nearby. “Where are we?”  

Avery looked up, their heart jolting.  

They knew this house.  

The hallway stretched ahead of them, narrow and dimly lit, the walls covered in peeling wallpaper. Framed pictures lined the walls, but the faces were blurred—unrecognizable.  

“No,” Avery whispered, scrambling to their feet. “No, no, no. This isn’t real.”  

“Avery?” Elise was watching them, worry etched into her face.  

“I know this place.” Avery’s voice trembled. “This is my parents’ house. I haven’t been here since…” They trailed off, their mind stuttering over the thought.  

Since what? Since *when?*  

Elise frowned, looking around. “Why would the signal bring us here?”  

“I don’t know,” Avery muttered, running a hand through their hair. “It’s not just distorting reality. It’s pulling from my memories.”  

A low creak echoed down the hallway.  

Both of them froze.  

The sound came again—slow, deliberate, like footsteps on old wood.  

Avery turned toward the source. The hallway seemed to stretch longer now, the far end swallowed in shadow. From within the darkness, something moved.  

A silhouette.  

And though it was shrouded, Avery knew—*knew*—it was watching them.  

Elise grabbed Avery’s arm, her grip firm. “We’re not staying here. Come on.”  

But Avery couldn’t move. The weight of the past, the unreality of it all, pinned them in place. “It’s *me*, Elise,” they said faintly, their voice hollow. “The signal isn’t random. It’s me. It’s pulling me apart.”  

The silhouette took a step closer.  

A whisper crawled out of the shadows, soft and sickly familiar.  

“Come back, Avery.”
