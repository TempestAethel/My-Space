## **Chapter 12: Through the Shadows (Part 1)**  

Avery’s breaths came in shallow gasps as the remnants of the shadowed forest vanished. The blinding light receded, leaving them kneeling on solid ground once again. This place was different, though—still. Silent. Empty.  

They wiped at their face with trembling hands, smearing the remnants of tears across their skin. The weight of what just happened pressed on their chest like a vice. The figure—the shifting, distorted *thing*—wasn’t gone. Not really. They could still feel its presence lingering like smoke in the back of their mind.  

*“You can’t run from me forever.”*  

Those words echoed inside Avery’s skull, pounding like a relentless drumbeat. Who—or what—was it? A figment of their broken psyche? Another trap set by the machine? Or…  

Their thoughts splintered.  

*What if it was something worse?*  

“No,” Avery muttered under their breath, shaking their head as they forced themselves to their feet. Their legs wobbled, weak from exhaustion and adrenaline, but they held. Somehow, they held.  

The path ahead stretched into a vast expanse of muted gray. The ground was hard and cold beneath Avery’s boots, resembling cracked stone or forgotten pavement. It spread out endlessly, meeting a horizon that shifted faintly, like heat waves shimmering in the distance.  

Avery squinted. Shapes loomed far away—dark silhouettes rising against the formless sky. Buildings, maybe.  

The sight made their pulse quicken.  

*Is this it? The real world?*  

No. That didn’t feel right.  

The air here was thin, unreal, as though the entire place was holding its breath. Avery turned slowly in a circle, scanning for anything—*anyone*—that could anchor them. But there was nothing.  

The silence buzzed.  

Their heart thumped louder in response, each beat reverberating inside their chest. Something was wrong here. The emptiness wasn’t peaceful. It was deliberate.  

*Manufactured.*  

Avery clenched their fists, forcing their mind to focus. “Think,” they muttered. “What did Elise say? Find the edges. Look for the cracks.”  

They glanced back over their shoulder, half-expecting the distorted figure to emerge from the void. But there was only empty space stretching into infinity.  

With a deep breath, Avery turned forward and started walking.  

Each step sent a hollow echo rippling across the cracked ground, as if the surface itself were fragile—waiting to splinter beneath them. The shapes on the horizon didn’t grow any closer, no matter how far Avery walked. It was as though the distance stretched to accommodate them, mocking their effort.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered to themselves. “None of this is real.”  

The words should have grounded them, but instead, the buzzing in the silence grew louder, filling the space around them like a swarm of unseen insects. Avery’s skin prickled with unease.  

*Something’s watching.*  

They stopped abruptly, their breathing ragged. Turning their head slowly, they scanned the endless expanse again. At first, there was nothing. Just the cold, gray horizon.  

Then they saw it.  

A shadow.  

It wasn’t a figure this time—nothing with form or edges. Just a patch of darkness far to the left, shifting faintly against the cracked ground like an ink stain spreading across paper.  

Avery’s blood ran cold.  

The shadow began to move.  

It slid across the ground, soundless and smooth, its edges rippling as though alive. It wasn’t heading toward Avery directly—more like circling, closing in with agonizing patience.  

Panic flared in Avery’s chest, and they stumbled backward, their boots scraping against the stone. “No,” they muttered. “No, no, no—”  

They turned and ran.  

The horizon didn’t get any closer. The buildings—if that’s what they were—stayed fixed in the shimmering distance. The shadows chased them, spreading faster now, sweeping across the ground in jagged waves.  

*It’s coming for you.*  

Avery’s mind screamed as their legs pumped harder, their lungs burning with the effort. The buzzing silence had turned into a roar, vibrating through the air like the sound of something massive waking up.  

They risked a glance over their shoulder—  

The shadows were everywhere.  

A black tide rolled across the gray expanse, swallowing the ground in its path. It moved with terrifying intent, faster than Avery could run.  

“No!” Avery screamed, pushing their body harder. “Let me out!”  

Their voice cracked, swallowed by the roar.  

Suddenly—  

A glint of *something* appeared in their peripheral vision. To the right, half-hidden by the shifting air, a sliver of *light* cut through the gray.  

A crack.  

Avery veered toward it without thinking, their body moving on pure instinct. The ground trembled beneath them as the shadows surged closer, the roaring sound now deafening.  

“Come on!” Avery screamed, throwing themselves forward.  

The crack of light grew brighter—wider—spreading like a tear through fabric. The shadows lunged, the edge of the black tide reaching for Avery’s heels—  

And then Avery leaped.  

They dove headfirst into the light, their body plunging through the crack just as the shadows snapped shut behind them.  

There was no impact.  

Just blinding, searing brightness.

## **Chapter 12: Through the Shadows (Part 2)**  

The blinding light enveloped Avery completely. For a moment, there was nothing—no sound, no sensation—just pure, overwhelming brightness that burned through their mind like a firestorm.  

Then, suddenly—  

They fell.  

Avery’s body tumbled through open air, disoriented and weightless, as though the world itself had been ripped out from under them. Wind roared in their ears, a chaotic howl that made it impossible to tell how far they were falling—or *where* they were falling to.  

It was endless. Infinite.  

And then—impact.  

The collision knocked the breath from Avery’s lungs as they hit solid ground, hard. Pain flared up their arms and into their ribs as they rolled onto their back, gasping for air. The world spun violently around them, blurring into streaks of gray, white, and shadow.  

For several long moments, Avery couldn’t move. They could only lie there, trembling, as they struggled to regain their breath.  

Slowly—too slowly—the spinning stopped. Avery blinked up at the sky. It wasn’t a sky at all, not really.  

Above them stretched a vast ceiling of reflective panels—shattered and fractured in places, but still glowing faintly with pale, flickering light. Each shard of glass reflected a different version of the world: distorted images of trees, corridors, buildings, and—  

*Themselves.*  

Avery’s chest tightened as they sat up, wincing at the soreness that spread through their body. The ground beneath them was smooth metal, cold against their fingertips, and surrounded by a shallow mist that hung close to the surface.  

They were inside some kind of massive structure—endless, empty, and echoing with the faint hum of unseen machines. The reflections above twisted and rippled, as though mocking their attempt to understand this place.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered, though the words tasted like ash in their mouth.  

It didn’t matter how many times they said it—this place *felt* real. The cold metal beneath their hands was solid. The distant hum of the machines vibrated through their bones.  

Avery staggered to their feet, clutching their side as they scanned the area. The space was massive and formless, its walls obscured by mist. In the distance, they could make out faint structures—columns, maybe, or machines—but nothing moved.  

*It’s a trap.*  

The thought surfaced like a dark whisper in the back of Avery’s mind.  

“This place isn’t real,” they said again, louder this time.  

From somewhere in the mist, a voice answered.  

*“Are you sure about that?”*  

Avery froze.  

The voice echoed across the space, low and smooth, like a shadow given form. Slowly, Avery turned, scanning the fog for any sign of movement.  

Nothing.  

But then, the voice spoke again—closer this time.  

*“You’ve been running, Avery. Running from the truth. How long do you think you can keep it up?”*  

The hairs on the back of Avery’s neck stood on end. “Show yourself!” they shouted, their voice cracking.  

For a long moment, there was silence. Then—  

A shape emerged from the mist.  

At first, it was nothing more than a shadow—vague and formless. But as it stepped closer, it took shape. Human. Familiar.  

Avery’s blood ran cold as they stared at the figure.  

It was *them.*  

Another Avery.  

This version looked identical, but wrong somehow—its posture too straight, its movements too deliberate. The figure’s eyes glowed faintly with a cold, unnatural light, and its expression was unreadable.  

“What—” Avery stammered, stumbling back. “What is this?”  

The other Avery tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile spreading across its lips.  

*“I’m you,”* it said simply. *“The real you.”*  

“No,” Avery choked out, shaking their head violently. “No, you’re not. You’re not real.”  

The figure stepped closer, its footsteps soundless on the metal floor.  

*“Why are you denying it? I’m the part of you that you’ve been trying to bury. The memories you don’t want. The truths you’re afraid to face.”*  

“Stop!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You’re lying!”  

*“Am I?”* the figure whispered.  

Before Avery could react, the other version of them lunged forward, moving impossibly fast. Avery barely had time to stumble backward before cold, vice-like hands clamped onto their shoulders, pinning them in place.  

The figure’s face loomed inches from Avery’s, its glowing eyes locking onto theirs.  

*“Let me show you.”*  

A surge of pain shot through Avery’s skull, blinding and sharp, like a thousand needles piercing their mind at once. They screamed, falling to their knees as memories—fragmented and disjointed—flooded their consciousness.  

**Blood. Screaming. A dark room filled with machines. A figure lying on a table—silent, unmoving. Their own hands stained red.**  

Avery clutched their head, their vision swimming as the memories fractured and reformed, each one worse than the last.  

“Stop!” they sobbed. “Please—stop!”  

The other Avery crouched down in front of them, its glowing eyes boring into Avery’s soul.  

*“You wanted to forget, remember? You thought you could erase the truth. But you can’t. It’s still here. I’m still here.”*  

The figure leaned closer, its voice dropping to a whisper.  

*“You’ll never escape me.”*  

With a final surge of force, Avery shoved the figure back. The glowing-eyed doppelgänger stumbled, its form flickering like static before dissolving into mist.  

Avery collapsed forward, gasping for breath. Their entire body shook, and their mind felt raw—like it had been torn open and left to bleed.  

For a long time, they lay there, unmoving.  

When they finally lifted their head, the mist had thinned, and the distant hum of machines had grown louder. The reflections above shimmered violently, the images fractured beyond recognition.  

Avery forced themselves to their feet, swaying unsteadily. The other Avery’s words lingered, poisoning their thoughts.  

*“You’ll never escape me.”*  

Avery swallowed hard, their fists clenching at their sides.  

“No,” they whispered. “I will.”  

With that, they turned toward the sound of the machines and started walking—each step heavier than the last.
