# **The Crumbling Citadel**  
## **Chapter 1: A World in Chains**  

### **Page 1**  

The citadel loomed over the city like a god's unblinking eye, its spires piercing the sickly green sky. It was said to hum at night, a low, droning sound that crept into the bones of the people below, reminding them of its power. For centuries, it had stood as both fortress and cathedral, an unshakable monument to the elite who ruled the world. From its pinnacle, reality itself could be bent to their will, and dissent was erased before it could take root.  

Kael stood in the shadow of the behemoth, his body tense with a mix of dread and defiance. The air around the citadel felt thicker, heavier, as though the tower itself exuded an unseen force. He adjusted the worn straps of his gear—a patchwork of salvaged armor and scavenged weapons. His dark eyes scanned the crowded streets below, where the common people moved like cattle, their faces vacant, their spirits long broken.  

He hated this city. Its narrow alleys, lined with crumbling tenements, seemed designed to trap the weak and poor. The streets stank of rot and despair, the filth of humanity crushed beneath the weight of the elite's rule. The citadel was not just a building; it was a symbol, an oppressive weight that pressed down on everyone who lived within its shadow.  

"Kael," a voice whispered, sharp and urgent.  

He turned to see Lira crouched in the alley behind him, her slim frame barely visible in the dim light. Her hands, calloused from years of labor, gripped the edges of her tattered cloak as if it could shield her from the tower's oppressive aura. "They're moving the patrols again. The shift starts earlier tonight."  

Kael nodded, his jaw tightening. The patrols were a constant reminder that rebellion was a dangerous, almost suicidal dream. The elite’s enforcers—men and women clad in black, their faces obscured by mirrored helmets—marched through the streets with precision, their weapons gleaming and their presence unnerving. Anyone caught out of line, or even suspected of disobedience, disappeared.  

"Let them move," Kael replied, his voice low but firm. "We're ready."  

Lira frowned, her deep-set eyes reflecting both worry and determination. "You say that every time, but these people aren’t soldiers. They’re starving. They're scared."  

Kael’s gaze shifted to the streets below, where a woman hurried past, clutching a child to her chest. The child’s hollow cheeks and wide, sunken eyes told the same story as every other soul in this cursed city: life here was not living. It was survival. Barely.  

"We don’t have the luxury of waiting," Kael said, his voice hardening. "If we don’t act now, they’ll die anyway. The towers won’t stop. The elite won’t stop. This isn’t just rebellion, Lira. It’s survival."  

Lira sighed but didn’t argue. She knew he was right, even if she hated the truth of it. Her fingers tightened around the edge of her cloak, her eyes darting toward the citadel’s distant gates.  

Kael turned back to her. "Is everyone in position?"  

"Almost," she said, her voice softening. "The west quadrant had trouble with their detonators. There’s something wrong with the charges—too much interference from..." She hesitated, her gaze flicking toward the citadel again. "...whatever it is those towers give off."  

Kael clenched his fists. It wasn’t the first time the towers’ unnatural energy had sabotaged their plans. The citadels were more than buildings. The elite had drawn something from beyond—something ancient and unfathomable—to fuel their power. That energy corrupted everything it touched.  

"It doesn’t matter," Kael said at last. "Tell them to move forward anyway. We can’t afford another delay."  

Lira hesitated, her expression tight with uncertainty. "And if it fails?"  

Kael met her gaze, his voice cold and resolute. "Then we die trying."  

Above them, the citadel’s spires gleamed in the dim light, a beacon of the power they sought to destroy. Kael knew this would be no easy fight. The towers were more than stone and steel—they were alive, in a way he couldn’t yet understand. But he also knew that no rebellion succeeded without sacrifice.  

As the first low rumble of footsteps echoed in the distance—the sound of the elite’s patrols approaching—Kael straightened, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade. The rebellion would begin tonight. And whether it ended in freedom or annihilation, it would mark the first crack in the citadel’s foundations.  

The hum of the tower grew louder, deeper, as though it sensed what was coming.  

---

### **Page 2**  

The hum deepened, a low, reverberating sound that seemed to vibrate in Kael’s chest. It wasn’t just noise—it was something alive, something that resonated with the fabric of reality itself. The citadel always felt like it was watching, waiting, as though it knew what people dared not say aloud. Tonight, that hum seemed almost... anticipatory, as if the tower anticipated the chaos to come.  

Kael shoved the unease aside, forcing himself to focus. He turned to Lira, his voice sharp. "Signal the others. The moment the patrol moves past the south gate, we strike. No delays, no second guesses."  

She gave a reluctant nod before disappearing into the shadows of the alley. Kael watched her go, her small frame swallowed by the darkness, and then turned his gaze back to the citadel. He hated giving orders that could lead people to their deaths, but what choice did they have? Every moment they delayed allowed the elite to tighten their grip.  

A sudden rustling sound to his left pulled him from his thoughts. Kael’s hand shot to the hilt of his blade as he whirled around, his eyes scanning the narrow alley. The dim light made it hard to see anything clearly, but after a moment, a figure emerged from the gloom—a young boy, no older than ten, his thin frame trembling.  

The boy’s clothes were ragged, his face smudged with dirt. His wide eyes were fixed on Kael, equal parts fear and curiosity. "You’re one of them, aren’t you?" the boy asked, his voice barely more than a whisper.  

Kael froze, his instincts screaming at him to move, to silence the boy before he could alert anyone. But the kid didn’t run. Instead, he edged closer, his movements hesitant but deliberate.  

"You’re with the ones trying to fight," the boy continued. "The ones trying to stop... them."  

Kael relaxed slightly, though his hand stayed near his weapon. "What do you know about it?"  

The boy’s gaze flicked toward the citadel, and his expression twisted into something raw—fear, anger, maybe both. "They took my sister. She didn’t do anything wrong, but they said she ‘disrupted the order.’ That’s what they always say."  

Kael’s jaw tightened. He’d heard the phrase too many times before. The elite didn’t need an excuse to take people. Anyone who spoke out, anyone who resisted even slightly, was labeled a threat. Most never returned, and those who did were... changed.  

"Go home," Kael said, his voice gruff. "This isn’t your fight."  

The boy shook his head, his small fists clenching. "There’s no home left. They came to our building yesterday, said we couldn’t stay there anymore. My mom said we’d find a new place, but..." His voice broke, and he swallowed hard, his eyes darting back to the citadel. "She didn’t come back either."  

Kael felt the familiar sting of rage and guilt building in his chest. He crouched down, meeting the boy’s gaze. "Listen to me," he said, his voice low and firm. "What’s your name?"  

"Ren," the boy whispered.  

"Ren, you’re brave to be out here, but this isn’t a safe place. Go find the others outside the city. There’s a camp near the northern ridge. Tell them Kael sent you. They’ll take care of you."  

The boy hesitated, his eyes scanning Kael’s face. "Will you make them pay? For my mom and my sister?"  

Kael’s hand tightened into a fist. "We’ll try," he said, though the words felt hollow.  

Before Ren could respond, the sound of boots on stone echoed down the street. Kael shot to his feet, his heart pounding. The patrol was close, their formation tight and unyielding. He grabbed Ren by the shoulder, steering him toward a side alley.  

"Go!" Kael hissed.  

Ren hesitated only for a moment before darting into the shadows, his small figure disappearing into the labyrinth of alleys. Kael exhaled slowly, his mind snapping back to the task at hand.  

The patrol marched into view, their black uniforms stark against the dim light of the streetlamps. There were six of them, their mirrored helmets reflecting the glow of the citadel. They moved in perfect unison, their boots striking the ground with mechanical precision.  

Kael pressed himself against the wall, his hand on his blade. He’d faced patrols before, but something about this group felt different. Their movements were too synchronized, too deliberate, as if they were connected by some unseen force.  

As the last of the patrol passed, Kael slipped from the shadows, his steps silent. He moved quickly, signaling to the others hidden nearby. Lira appeared first, followed by three more rebels, each armed with crude weapons. Their faces were grim, their eyes sharp with determination.  

"The charges are set," Lira whispered, nodding toward the south gate. "All we need is your signal."  

Kael glanced at the patrol, now nearing the gate. The hum of the citadel grew louder, almost deafening. It vibrated in his skull, making it hard to think. For a moment, he hesitated, the weight of what they were about to do pressing down on him.  

This wasn’t just another raid. This was the beginning of something much larger—something they couldn’t take back.  

"Now," Kael said, his voice steady.  

Lira raised her hand, and a series of faint, distant clicks echoed through the air as the detonators activated. The ground beneath them shuddered, and a split second later, the night exploded into chaos.

---
### **Page 3**  

The explosion tore through the air with a deafening roar, the force of it shaking the crumbling tenements lining the street. Fire and debris erupted from the south gate, engulfing the patrol in an instant. The night lit up in flashes of orange and red, the heat searing even from a distance.  

Kael ducked instinctively as shards of metal and stone rained down around him. The acrid smell of burning fuel and ash filled his lungs, mingling with the screams of the dying. He didn’t let himself look too long at the crumpled forms where the patrol had been standing—there wasn’t time for guilt now.  

"Lira, move!" he barked, pulling her from her crouched position.  

The rest of the rebels emerged from the shadows, their movements quick but chaotic. Most of them were untrained—miners, farmers, and scavengers pressed into service by desperation. Their faces were pale in the flickering firelight, but their weapons were ready.  

"Push forward!" Kael ordered. "Get to the gate before they regroup!"  

The rebels surged ahead, pouring into the street like a flood. Kael ran with them, his blade drawn and ready. The south gate was in ruins, twisted metal and shattered stone scattered across the ground. Beyond it lay the outer courtyard of the citadel—a cold, sterile expanse of polished black stone that reflected the flames.  

Kael slowed as they reached the edge of the courtyard, his instincts screaming at him to stop. Something felt wrong. The hum of the citadel was louder here, vibrating in the very air. It wasn’t just sound—it was a presence, oppressive and heavy, pressing down on him like a weight he couldn’t shake.  

"Kael," Lira said, her voice tight. She was standing a few feet away, her eyes locked on something ahead.  

He followed her gaze, and his stomach twisted.  

The citadel’s main doors had opened.  

A figure stepped out, silhouetted against the unnatural green light spilling from within. At first, Kael thought it was one of the enforcers—tall, armored, and imposing. But as the figure moved closer, it became clear that this was something else.  

The armor was wrong, its surface black and pulsing like a living thing. Veins of faint, glowing light ran through it, twisting and shifting as though alive. The figure’s movements were smooth, almost too smooth, as if the body beneath the armor didn’t move naturally. And the helmet—Kael couldn’t look at it for more than a second without a wave of nausea washing over him.  

"What... is that?" one of the rebels whispered, his voice shaking.  

Kael didn’t answer. His heart was pounding, his grip tightening on his blade. The figure stopped just short of the ruined gate, standing unnaturally still. The hum of the citadel seemed to grow louder, resonating from the figure itself.  

And then it spoke.  

"Fools."  

The voice was deep and distorted, echoing as though it came from everywhere at once. It wasn’t human—it couldn’t be. The rebels froze, their resolve faltering under the weight of that single word.  

"You think you understand power?" the figure continued, its head tilting slightly. The glowing veins along its armor pulsed in time with the words. "You are insects playing in the shadow of gods."  

Kael’s jaw clenched. He forced himself to step forward, raising his blade. "We’re done living under your shadow," he said, his voice sharp. "Your gods, your towers—they’ll all fall."  

The figure turned its helmeted head toward him, and Kael felt his stomach churn. He could feel the thing’s attention like a physical force, pressing into his mind.  

"Such confidence," it said. "Such arrogance."  

Before Kael could react, the figure moved. It was impossibly fast, crossing the distance between them in a blink. A clawed hand—black and sleek, like the rest of its armor—slashed out, aiming for his throat.  

Kael barely managed to raise his blade in time. Sparks flew as the claw collided with steel, the force of the blow sending him staggering backward. His arms burned from the impact, and his grip on the weapon faltered.  

The figure didn’t give him time to recover. It lunged again, this time aiming for his chest. Kael braced himself, but before the blow could land, another figure darted in from the side.  

Lira.  

She drove a jagged piece of metal into the thing’s side, the improvised weapon glowing faintly as it struck. For a moment, the figure faltered, its movements jerking unnaturally.  

"Go!" Lira shouted, her voice strained.  

Kael didn’t hesitate. He turned, grabbing the nearest rebel by the arm. "Fall back! Get to cover!"  

The rebels scrambled, retreating toward the narrow alleys beyond the gate. Kael hesitated only for a second, his gaze flicking back to Lira. She was still fighting, her movements quick but desperate as she dodged the creature’s attacks.  

"Lira!" he called, but she didn’t look back.  

"Go!" she shouted again, driving her weapon into the figure’s chest.  

The thing let out a guttural sound, something between a growl and a screech. Its claws lashed out, catching Lira’s arm and sending her sprawling to the ground.  

Kael took a step toward her, but the figure turned its head toward him, and he froze. The glowing veins on its armor pulsed brighter, and the hum of the citadel became deafening.  

"Leave her!" one of the rebels shouted, pulling at Kael’s arm.  

Every instinct screamed at him to stay, to fight, but he knew it was useless. Gritting his teeth, he turned and ran, following the others into the labyrinth of alleys.  

Behind him, the hum of the citadel grew louder still, drowning out the sounds of the battle. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped.  

---

### **Page 4**  

The silence was worse than the noise.  

Kael’s boots pounded against the uneven stone streets as he led the rebels through the twisting alleys. The chaotic roar of the explosion had faded, replaced by an eerie stillness that seemed to press against his ears. Even the distant hum of the citadel had gone quiet, leaving only the muffled sound of their ragged breaths and hurried footsteps.  

Lira.  

Her name echoed in his mind, a weight heavier than the blade at his side. He clenched his jaw, forcing himself to focus. He couldn’t afford to stop. Not now.  

"Where are we going?" one of the rebels hissed, his voice tight with panic. The man—Darrin, a wiry scavenger who had joined their cause only weeks ago—looked over his shoulder nervously. "They’ll be coming after us! We’re sitting ducks out here!"  

Kael rounded a corner, glancing briefly behind them. The alley stretched into darkness, the flames from the explosion barely visible in the distance. No sign of pursuit—yet. But he knew that wouldn’t last.  

"Keep moving," Kael ordered. His tone left no room for argument, though the fear gnawed at the edges of his resolve. "We need to regroup with the others at the safe house."  

Darrin muttered something under his breath but fell into step behind Kael. The rest of the group—eight rebels in total—moved with a mix of urgency and exhaustion, their weapons clutched tightly. Most of them hadn’t expected to survive this long.  

"Kael," another voice called softly. This time it was Jorin, a burly man with a deep scar running across his face. He slowed his pace to walk beside Kael, his brow furrowed. "What happened back there? That... thing. It wasn’t human."  

Kael didn’t answer immediately. His mind flashed back to the figure at the gate—the pulsing veins of light, the unnatural movements, the overwhelming presence. It had felt wrong, like something that didn’t belong in their world.  

"I don’t know," Kael said finally, his voice low. "But whatever it was, it came from the citadel. That much is clear."  

Jorin frowned, his grip tightening on the makeshift axe slung over his shoulder. "I thought we were fighting the elite. Humans. Not... whatever that was."  

"We are," Kael replied. "But the towers—there’s more to them than we understand. The elite have been drawing power from something... unnatural. That’s how they’ve kept control for so long."  

Jorin didn’t respond, but his expression darkened. The truth was difficult to accept, even for Kael. They had always known the citadels were more than just symbols of power. The strange energy they emitted, the whispers that seemed to crawl into people’s minds—it had all been there, just beneath the surface. But seeing it manifest so directly was something else entirely.  

They turned another corner, the alley opening into a wider street. The safe house was just ahead—a nondescript building wedged between two dilapidated tenements. Its windows were boarded up, and the door was reinforced with scrap metal.  

Kael slowed, raising a hand to signal the others. "Stay alert," he murmured.  

The group fanned out, their weapons ready as they approached the building. Kael stepped forward, knocking twice on the metal door in a deliberate rhythm. A moment later, a narrow slit opened, and a pair of wary eyes peered out.  

"It’s us," Kael said quietly.  

The door creaked open, and the rebels hurried inside. The room beyond was dimly lit, the air thick with the smell of sweat and oil. A handful of others were already there—members of the rebellion who had been waiting for Kael’s team to return.  

"Did you succeed?" one of them asked, a middle-aged woman with sharp features and a mechanical brace on her arm. Her name was Marek, one of the rebellion’s engineers.  

Kael hesitated. "The gate is down," he said. "But we lost people. And..." He paused, searching for the right words. "Something came out of the citadel. Something we weren’t prepared for."  

Marek’s expression hardened. "What do you mean?"  

Before Kael could answer, Darrin stepped forward, his voice shaking. "It wasn’t human," he said. "It moved like a shadow—too fast, too strong. And it didn’t even flinch when we hit it."  

Marek frowned, her gaze shifting to Kael. "Is this what we’ve been up against this whole time? Is this what they’ve been hiding in those towers?"  

"I don’t know," Kael admitted. "But whatever it was, it’s only the beginning."  

The room fell silent, the weight of his words sinking in.  

Suddenly, a faint rumble shook the floor, and everyone froze. It was subtle at first, but it grew steadily louder—a deep, rhythmic vibration that seemed to come from everywhere at once.  

"The hum," Marek whispered, her voice barely audible.  

Kael’s stomach dropped. The hum of the citadel was back, stronger than ever. It wasn’t just sound—it was a presence, pressing against his mind like cold fingers.  

"Get ready," he said, his voice sharp. "They’ve found us."  

The rebels scrambled into action, locking the door and positioning themselves near the windows. Weapons were raised, and breaths were held.  

Kael moved to the center of the room, his blade in hand, his heart pounding in his chest. Outside, the hum grew louder, resonating through the walls like a heartbeat.  

And then, from the shadows beyond the barricaded windows, a single glowing figure emerged.  

---

### **Page 5**  

The glowing figure stood motionless in the street, its pulsating light casting eerie shadows on the surrounding buildings. Its armor gleamed black, veins of pale green energy twisting along its surface like living things. The hum seemed to emanate from its very being, vibrating through the walls of the safe house and into Kael’s chest.  

The rebels froze, their weapons trembling in their hands. No one dared to speak. The room was filled with the quiet sound of shallow breaths and the faint creak of strained floorboards.  

Kael stepped forward, his blade ready, his gaze locked on the figure outside. "What do you want?" he called, his voice steady despite the tension in the room.  

The figure tilted its head slightly, the movement too smooth, too deliberate. When it spoke, its voice echoed unnaturally, layered with a distorted, otherworldly tone.  

"You do not belong here," it said, its words like nails scraping across Kael’s mind.  

Kael’s grip on his blade tightened. "We belong as much as anyone else. This is our city—our world. You have no right to take it from us."  

The figure didn’t respond immediately. It seemed to study Kael, its glowing veins pulsing faintly. When it spoke again, its voice was colder, more distant.  

"Your defiance is meaningless. The towers stand as they always have. Your kind will kneel, or you will cease to exist."  

A chill ran through the room, the weight of the figure’s words pressing down on everyone like a physical force.  

"We’ve already brought one of your towers down," Kael said, his voice sharp. "And we’ll bring down the rest. Your time is over."  

The figure stepped closer, its movements unnaturally fluid. "You do not understand what you are unleashing. The towers are not yours to destroy. They are the anchors of this reality. Without them, your world will unravel."  

Kael hesitated, the words gnawing at the edges of his resolve. He didn’t trust the figure—whatever it was—but there was a weight to its warning that he couldn’t ignore. Still, he pushed the doubt aside. The rebellion had no room for hesitation.  

"Let it unravel," he said, his voice firm. "We’ll take that chance over living under your rule."  

The figure paused, its head tilting again. Then, without warning, it raised a clawed hand. The glow of its veins brightened, and the hum grew louder, vibrating the air around them.  

"Kael!" Lira’s voice shouted from the far side of the room, cutting through the tension.  

He turned, his heart leaping. Lira stood in the doorway of a side room, clutching her injured arm. Blood stained the tattered fabric of her sleeve, but her eyes burned with determination. "We have to move! Now!"  

"Lira, you’re alive," Kael said, relief flooding his voice.  

"I don’t plan on staying that way if we sit here any longer," she snapped, glancing toward the glowing figure outside. "They’ve got more coming. This place is a trap."  

Kael turned back to the figure, its glow now intensifying. Whatever it was doing, it wasn’t going to wait much longer.  

"Everyone, out the back!" he barked, motioning to the rebels.  

They hesitated only briefly before scrambling toward the narrow door leading to the alley behind the safe house. Lira moved to Kael’s side, her face pale but determined.  

"What are we dealing with?" she asked, her voice low.  

"I don’t know," Kael admitted. "But it doesn’t want us alive."  

A sudden, ear-splitting crack filled the air, and the room shuddered violently. The walls began to warp, the wooden beams groaning as if under immense pressure. The glowing figure stepped closer, its presence now bending the very fabric of the room.  

"Go," Kael said, pushing Lira toward the others.  

"What about you?" she demanded, her voice rising in anger.  

"I’ll hold it off," he said firmly. "You need to get them out of here."  

Lira hesitated, her eyes searching his face. "Don’t be an idiot, Kael. You can’t fight that thing alone."  

"I don’t have a choice," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Now go!"  

Before she could protest further, the figure raised its hand again. A wave of energy burst forth, tearing through the air and slamming into the room. The force sent Kael sprawling, his blade skidding across the floor.  

"Kael!" Lira shouted, but one of the rebels grabbed her arm, pulling her toward the back door.  

Kael pushed himself to his feet, his vision swimming. The figure loomed over him now, its pulsing glow almost blinding. The hum was deafening, vibrating in his skull like a living thing.  

"You are nothing," the figure said, its voice a cold, hollow echo.  

Kael gritted his teeth, grabbing his blade. His body ached, and his mind felt like it was tearing at the seams, but he refused to back down. He raised the weapon, his gaze locked on the creature.  

"Maybe," he said, his voice hoarse. "But I’m not done yet."  

The figure surged forward, its claws outstretched. Kael braced himself, his grip tightening on the hilt of his blade. He wasn’t sure he could win, but if this was the end, he would face it standing.  

As the creature lunged, the room around them seemed to collapse inward, the air warping like a mirage. Kael swung his blade, the hum reaching a deafening crescendo.  

---
### **Page 6**  

The clash was deafening. Kael’s blade connected with the creature’s claws, sparks flying in the dim, warped space of the room. He strained against its strength, his arms trembling as the weight of the unnatural being bore down on him. The glowing veins along its armor pulsed brighter, casting flickering green light across the walls.  

Kael could feel the hum now not just in his ears but deep within his chest, vibrating through his bones. His teeth clenched as he shoved back, forcing the creature to stumble for a moment. It wasn’t much, but it gave him the precious second he needed to reposition himself.  

Behind him, the rebels were scrambling out through the back entrance, their hurried footsteps fading into the alley. Lira’s voice rose above the chaos, shouting orders to keep them moving. Kael spared a glance over his shoulder, relief washing over him as he saw her retreating figure.  

But the distraction cost him.  

The creature lunged again, faster than before. Its clawed hand swiped at Kael’s side, tearing through his armor like it was paper. Pain exploded along his ribs, hot and sharp, and he staggered back, barely staying on his feet. Blood seeped through the torn leather of his armor, warm against his skin.  

"You cannot resist," the creature intoned, its voice reverberating unnaturally. "Your kind is fragile, weak. This rebellion will crumble, just as you will."  

Kael forced himself upright, gripping his blade with both hands. The room around him seemed to warp and twist, the walls bending at unnatural angles. His vision blurred, but he steadied himself, focusing on the glowing figure before him.  

"We’ve been fragile for centuries," Kael spat, his voice rough with pain. "And we’re still here."  

With a roar, he charged forward, swinging his blade in a wide arc. The creature blocked the attack with ease, but Kael didn’t stop. He struck again and again, each blow deflecting off its pulsing armor with a shower of sparks. He knew he couldn’t win—not in a conventional sense. But if he could hold it off long enough for the others to escape, that would be enough.  

The creature seemed to grow annoyed, its movements becoming more aggressive. It lashed out with both claws, its strikes faster and harder. Kael dodged the first, but the second caught his shoulder, throwing him back against the wall. The impact knocked the breath from his lungs, and he slumped to the floor, his blade slipping from his grasp.  

The creature loomed over him, its glowing veins pulsating with what almost seemed like anticipation. The hum in the air grew louder, deeper, vibrating through the floor beneath him. Kael struggled to rise, his vision swimming, but his body refused to obey.  

"You will kneel," the creature said, raising one clawed hand for the final strike.  

Kael closed his eyes, bracing himself for the end.  

And then, suddenly, a deafening roar echoed through the room. The wall behind the creature exploded inward, sending chunks of stone and debris flying in all directions. The force of the blast knocked the creature off balance, and it stumbled forward, its movements jerky and disoriented.  

Kael opened his eyes just in time to see a figure stepping through the smoke and rubble. It was Lira, her face grim, a small, glowing device clutched tightly in her hand.  

"Get up, Kael!" she shouted, her voice cutting through the chaos.  

He didn’t need to be told twice. Gritting his teeth against the pain, he pushed himself to his feet, grabbing his blade. The creature turned toward Lira, its glowing veins flickering erratically as if it were struggling to recover.  

Lira hurled the device at the creature, the glow intensifying as it sailed through the air. The moment it connected, the device detonated in a blinding flash of light and energy. The creature let out a guttural screech, its form writhing as the blast tore into it.  

Kael shielded his eyes from the brilliance, his heart pounding. When the light finally faded, the creature was gone. All that remained was a faint, smoldering scorch mark on the warped floor.  

Lira turned to him, her expression tight. "We need to go. Now."  

Kael nodded, his body screaming in protest as he followed her toward the back exit. The hum of the citadel had quieted for the moment, but he knew it wouldn’t last. The battle was far from over.  

---
### **Page 7**  

Kael staggered after Lira, his vision still swimming from the explosion. The narrow alley behind the safe house was dark, illuminated only by the faint, unnatural glow of the citadel looming in the distance. Every step sent sharp pain radiating from the wound along his ribs, but he grit his teeth and kept moving. They couldn’t afford to stop.  

Ahead of him, Lira moved quickly despite the blood staining her arm. She glanced over her shoulder, her expression unreadable. "How bad is it?"  

"Just a scratch," Kael lied, his voice tight.  

Lira gave him a look but didn’t press the issue. "We’ll have to circle around to the fallback point. The others should’ve made it by now."  

Kael nodded, though the thought of leading them through the twisting, hostile streets of the city filled him with dread. Every shadow felt alive, every distant noise a potential threat. Whatever that thing in the safe house had been, he doubted it was the only one.  

As they moved further from the ruined building, the faint hum of the citadel began to creep back into the air, like the distant sound of a storm on the horizon. Kael glanced back toward the towering structure, its spires glowing faintly in the sickly green light of the sky.  

"That thing," he said after a moment, his voice low. "It wasn’t just some tool of the elite. It was..." He trailed off, searching for the right words.  

"Wrong," Lira finished for him.  

Kael nodded. "Do you think it was one of them? One of the rulers?"  

Lira hesitated, her gaze flicking toward the citadel. "Maybe. Or maybe it was something they created. Either way, it wasn’t human anymore."  

The weight of her words settled over them, thick and suffocating. Kael had always known the elite were dangerous, their power far beyond anything the rebellion could truly understand. But this... this was something else entirely.  

They turned a corner, the alley opening into a wider street. The buildings here were crumbling, their facades blackened by years of neglect. The only light came from the faint, flickering glow of the citadel in the distance, casting distorted shadows across the ground.  

"Do you think the others made it?" Lira asked, her voice softer now.  

Kael wanted to reassure her, to say that the rebels had escaped safely and were already regrouping at the fallback point. But the truth was, he didn’t know. The safe house had been their last secure position in this part of the city, and with the patrols closing in, there were no guarantees.  

"They’ll make it," he said finally, forcing conviction into his voice. "They have to."  

Lira didn’t respond, but the tension in her expression didn’t ease.  

As they moved further into the city, the streets grew quieter. The oppressive hum of the citadel seemed to fade slightly, though Kael knew it was only temporary. The eerie silence was almost worse, amplifying every creak of the broken buildings and every scuff of their boots against the cracked pavement.  

They approached a narrow bridge spanning a dried-up canal, its stone surface slick with grime. On the far side, Kael spotted movement—a shadow slipping behind a broken pillar.  

"Wait," he said, holding out a hand to stop Lira.  

She froze, her eyes scanning the bridge. "What is it?"  

Kael squinted into the darkness, his fingers tightening around the hilt of his blade. "Someone’s there."  

For a moment, neither of them moved. The shadow reappeared, and this time, Kael caught a glimpse of a figure—human, from what he could tell—crouched low near the edge of the bridge.  

"Rebels?" Lira whispered.  

"Or worse," Kael replied grimly.  

He stepped forward cautiously, keeping his blade ready. "Who’s there?" he called, his voice firm but not aggressive.  

The figure hesitated, then slowly stood. It was a man, thin and disheveled, his clothes torn and filthy. He held his hands up in a gesture of surrender, his eyes wide with fear.  

"Don’t—don’t shoot," the man stammered, his voice shaking. "I’m not with them."  

Kael exchanged a glance with Lira before stepping closer. "Who are you?"  

The man swallowed hard, his gaze darting between them. "Just a scavenger. I—I saw the explosion. Thought maybe I could find something useful..."  

Lira stepped forward, her expression sharp. "You’ve been following us?"  

The man shook his head quickly. "No! No, I swear. I was just hiding. I didn’t think anyone else would be out here."  

Kael studied him for a moment, his instincts on edge. The man looked harmless enough, but in this city, desperation could make anyone dangerous.  

"Stay out of our way," Kael said finally, lowering his blade. "And don’t follow us."  

The man nodded quickly, backing away toward the shadows. "I won’t. I promise."  

As the scavenger disappeared into the darkness, Lira frowned. "Do you think he was telling the truth?"  

Kael shook his head. "I don’t know. But we can’t afford to take chances."  

They continued across the bridge, their pace quickening. The fallback point wasn’t far now—a hidden network of tunnels beneath the old industrial district. If the others had made it, they would be waiting there.  

But as the citadel’s hum began to grow louder once again, Kael couldn’t shake the feeling that the rebellion was only just beginning to understand the true scope of what they were fighting.

### **Page 8**  

Kael and Lira moved swiftly through the abandoned streets, their footsteps echoing faintly in the emptiness. The industrial district loomed ahead, its jagged silhouette cutting sharply against the sky. Twisted metal beams jutted out from skeletal buildings, their rusted surfaces gleaming faintly in the dim light.  

The rebellion’s fallback point lay beneath these ruins—a hidden system of tunnels once used for water and waste, long since abandoned. It wasn’t much, but it was the safest place they had left.  

"We’re close," Lira murmured, glancing over her shoulder. Her injured arm hung limply at her side, the bloodstain on her sleeve growing darker.  

Kael nodded, his jaw tightening. His ribs throbbed with every step, and the dried blood on his side was beginning to pull at his skin. But pain didn’t matter—not now.  

They turned down a narrow alley, its walls lined with rusted pipes and broken machinery. The entrance to the tunnels was just ahead, hidden beneath a pile of collapsed metal scaffolding. Kael quickened his pace, his instincts urging him to reach safety as quickly as possible.  

"Do you hear that?" Lira asked suddenly, her voice hushed.  

Kael stopped, his head tilting slightly as he listened. At first, there was only silence, but then—faint and distant—the hum of the citadel reached his ears. It was growing louder again, like a storm rolling in from the horizon.  

"Move," he said sharply, grabbing Lira’s uninjured arm and pulling her forward.  

They reached the pile of scaffolding, and Kael dropped to his knees, clearing away some of the debris to reveal a narrow, rusted hatch beneath. He pounded on it twice in quick succession, then paused, his hand hovering over the metal.  

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a loud creak, the hatch swung open from the inside, revealing a familiar face.  

"Kael!" Jorin’s deep voice rumbled as he pulled the hatch open wider. His scarred face was lit with relief as he reached out to help Kael and Lira inside. "We thought you didn’t make it."  

"We almost didn’t," Kael said, lowering himself into the tunnel. The air inside was damp and heavy, carrying the faint smell of mildew.  

Lira followed close behind, her expression tight with pain. As soon as she was inside, Jorin swung the hatch shut, locking it securely.  

The tunnel was dimly lit by a series of makeshift lanterns, their flickering light casting long shadows on the walls. The rebels who had escaped the safe house were gathered further down the passage, their faces pale and weary.  

"Is this all that’s left?" Kael asked, his voice low.  

Jorin nodded grimly. "We lost a lot back there. Darrin didn’t make it. Neither did Marek."  

Kael’s stomach twisted, but he forced himself to focus. He couldn’t afford to grieve—not yet. "Any sign of pursuit?"  

"Not yet," Jorin replied. "But with the way that thing moved..." He trailed off, his brow furrowing. "It’s only a matter of time, isn’t it?"  

Kael nodded, his expression grim. "We need to figure out our next move. These tunnels won’t keep us safe for long."  

Lira leaned against the wall, her breathing shallow. "We can’t just keep running," she said, her voice tight. "That thing at the safe house—it’s not going to stop. And I don’t think it’s the only one."  

The other rebels shifted uneasily, their fear palpable in the confined space.  

Kael ran a hand through his hair, his mind racing. He had always known the rebellion was a long shot, but now, the odds felt insurmountable. The elite weren’t just men and women with power—they were something far worse, something beyond human.  

"We need answers," Kael said finally, his voice steady despite the turmoil in his chest. "We need to know what we’re really fighting."  

"And how do you plan to do that?" Jorin asked, his tone skeptical.  

Kael’s gaze shifted toward the distant hum of the citadel, its presence lingering in his mind like a poison. "We go back to the towers," he said. "If we’re going to stop this, we need to understand what’s inside them."  

The room fell silent, the weight of his words sinking in.  

"Are you insane?" one of the rebels blurted out, his voice rising with panic. "You saw what came out of the last tower! If we go anywhere near another one, we’re dead!"  

"Maybe," Kael admitted. "But if we don’t, we’re dead anyway. This rebellion was never about playing it safe."  

Lira straightened, her eyes narrowing. "You want to infiltrate a tower? That’s suicide, Kael."  

"It’s the only way," he replied. "We’ve been fighting in the dark for too long. If we don’t figure out what the elite are using to control those towers—what they’re drawing power from—then we’ve already lost."  

Jorin sighed, rubbing a hand over his scarred face. "You’re talking about storming the heart of their power, Kael. You realize what you’re asking, don’t you?"  

Kael met his gaze, his expression hard. "I do. And I’m not asking anyone to come with me. If you want to stay here and wait for the towers to fall on us, that’s your choice. But I’m not giving up."  

The rebels exchanged uneasy glances, their fear mingling with a flicker of determination.  

"I’ll go," Lira said suddenly, her voice cutting through the tension.  

Kael turned to her, his eyes widening. "Lira—"  

"Don’t argue," she interrupted. "If you’re going into a tower, you’re going to need someone to keep you alive. And besides..." Her gaze hardened. "I have just as much reason to fight as you do."  

Kael hesitated, but he saw the resolve in her eyes and knew better than to argue. He nodded. "Alright. We leave at first light."  

As the others began murmuring amongst themselves, Kael sat down against the damp wall of the tunnel, exhaustion washing over him. He closed his eyes, the hum of the citadel still echoing faintly in the back of his mind.  

The rebellion wasn’t over—not yet. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that the real fight was only just beginning.
