# **The Crumbling Citadel**  
## **Chapter 4: Awakening the Sigil**  

### **Page 1**

The creature’s screech reached a deafening pitch as the sigil’s power surged, the light now blinding and pulsating in waves. The defenders fought to hold their ground, but the air itself seemed to resist them, pressing down with an almost suffocating weight.  

Lira’s hands trembled as she poured every ounce of her will into the sigil. Her mind teetered on the edge of collapse, fragments of alien whispers clawing at her consciousness.  

Kael crouched beside her, his sword in hand, his voice cutting through the chaos. “Lira, stay with me! Don’t let it win!”  

“I’m trying!” she cried, her voice breaking. “It’s... it’s too much!”  

The creature writhed, its limbs flailing as the sigil’s energy tore into its form. The room seemed to pulse with the rhythm of a beating heart, the walls bending and twisting under the strain.  

Jorin’s axe found purchase in one of the creature’s larger appendages, severing it with a sickening squelch. Green ichor sprayed across the floor, but the severed limb dissolved into mist, reforming moments later.  

“It’s not enough!” Jorin bellowed, his face twisted in frustration. “We can’t kill it!”  

Kael turned to Lira, desperation flickering in his eyes. “What do we do?”  

Lira’s breath came in ragged gasps. “The sigil... it’s a conduit. It’s drawing power from somewhere, but it needs... a focus.”  

Kael’s mind raced. “What kind of focus?”  

Lira hesitated, her gaze meeting his. “A life. It needs a life to complete the connection.”  

The words hung heavy in the air, the weight of their meaning settling over the room.  

“No,” Jorin said, his voice sharp. “There has to be another way.”  

“There isn’t,” Lira said, her voice trembling. “If we don’t stop it now, it will consume everything. We’ll all die.”  

The defenders exchanged uneasy glances, their resolve faltering. Kael looked around the room, his jaw clenched. He knew what had to be done, but the thought of sacrificing one of their own filled him with dread.  

“I’ll do it,” Lira said softly, her hands still pressed against the glowing sigil.  

“No!” Kael snapped, grabbing her arm. “You’re the only one who understands this thing. We need you alive.”  

“Then who?” she asked, her voice barely audible.  

Silence fell over the room, broken only by the creature’s guttural roars.  

Jorin stepped forward, his expression grim. “I’ll do it,” he said, his voice steady.  

Kael shook his head. “You’re the best fighter we have. We need you.”  

Jorin met his gaze, his eyes unwavering. “You need everyone, Kael. But someone has to make the call.”  

Before Kael could respond, the creature surged forward, its massive form slamming into the defenders. Chaos erupted as the barricade gave way entirely, the beast pouring into the room like a living flood.  

Jorin turned to Kael, his face set with determination. “Keep fighting. Don’t let this be for nothing.”  

Without another word, he stepped toward the sigil, his body bathed in its glowing light.  

“Jorin, wait—” Kael started, but it was too late.  

Jorin placed his hands on the sigil, and the room erupted in a blinding flash of light.

The flash of light engulfed the room, consuming everything in a searing brilliance that forced everyone to shield their eyes. The creature let out a deafening wail, its massive form spasming as the sigil’s power surged through it.  

Kael stumbled back, his vision swimming with afterimages. He could barely make out Jorin’s silhouette, standing resolute at the center of the storm, his hands pressed against the sigil. The energy pouring from it swirled around him, threading through his body like glowing veins.  

“Jorin!” Kael shouted, his voice hoarse.  

Jorin turned his head slightly, his face illuminated by the unearthly light. “Keep them safe, Kael,” he said, his voice calm despite the chaos. “This is the only way.”  

The creature’s wail turned into a high-pitched screech as the sigil’s power intensified. Its limbs thrashed wildly, smashing against the walls and floor, but it couldn’t break free of the energy binding it.  

Lira crawled back from the sigil, her body trembling. “It’s working,” she whispered, her voice a mix of awe and horror. “The sigil is... consuming it.”  

Kael gritted his teeth, forcing himself to stand. “Jorin, get out of there! You don’t have to—”  

Jorin shook his head. “This is what I can give. Don’t waste it.”  

The sigil’s light grew brighter, its energy now crackling like a living thing. The creature’s form began to dissolve, its edges breaking apart into streams of green mist that were drawn into the sigil.  

Jorin’s body began to change as well. The light threaded through him, his features softening and blurring. He let out a pained gasp but didn’t pull away.  

Kael felt a knot of anguish tighten in his chest. He wanted to charge forward, to pull Jorin back, but his feet felt rooted to the ground. He could only watch as his friend gave himself to the sigil.  

With one final, blinding pulse, the sigil’s energy erupted outward, sweeping through the room like a tidal wave. The defenders were thrown to the ground, their weapons clattering to the floor.  

When the light finally dimmed, the creature was gone. The room was silent, save for the ragged breathing of the survivors.  

Kael forced himself to his feet, his legs shaking. He looked toward the sigil, now dim and inert. Jorin was gone.  

Lira sat slumped against the wall, her face pale and streaked with tears. “He... he did it,” she murmured. “He stopped it.”  

Kael approached the sigil, his heart heavy. He stared at the empty space where Jorin had stood, his fists clenched. The cost of their victory weighed on him like a stone.  

One of the fighters limped forward, his voice trembling. “What now, Kael? What do we do now?”  

Kael turned to face the group, his expression hardening. “We keep going,” he said, his voice firm despite the ache in his chest. “We honor Jorin’s sacrifice by making sure it wasn’t in vain. We take the fight to them.”  

The defenders nodded, their resolve renewed despite their losses.  

Kael glanced at Lira, who gave him a faint, exhausted nod. Together, they turned toward the door, leaving the ruins of the sigil—and Jorin’s sacrifice—behind.
