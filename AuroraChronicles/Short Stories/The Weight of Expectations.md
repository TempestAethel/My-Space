# **The Weight of Expectations**

**Ryan** sat in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection. The dark circles under his eyes told a story he couldn't say aloud. Each day felt like a battlefield—fighting unseen wars in his mind, carrying the expectations of a world that demanded too much and gave too little.

Movies and shows painted a picture of the *“perfect man”*—the strong, stoic protector. **Be tough, show no weakness, and handle it all**—that’s what they always said. His father once told him, *“Men don’t cry, son. Be a man.”* Those words had embedded themselves deep, an anchor dragging him down whenever he felt vulnerable.

Yet all Ryan really wanted was *peace*. Not perfection. Not strength. Just the quiet freedom to be human.

## **The Unseen Battles**

It wasn’t just the big expectations that weighed him down. It was the little things—how people said things, how their words cut deeper than they realized.

“Your beard makes you look scruffy,” his girlfriend had once said, wrinkling her nose. She didn’t know how those words replayed in his head like a broken record. It wasn’t what she meant, but it’s what he heard: *“You’re not enough as you are.”*

Imagine, he thought, if instead she had said, *“You look so nice when you’re clean-shaven.”* Same message, different impact. One gave a reason to feel better. The other made him feel like a failure.

“Why don’t you ever talk about your problems?” his friends asked, unaware that he spent hours talking to himself, trying to untangle the thoughts in his mind. **Would they really listen? Or would they just tell him to ‘man up’?** He didn’t know. So he stayed silent.

## **Breaking Down**

The pressure built slowly—like water filling a dam. Ryan buried himself in work, fitness routines, and mindless scrolling. Anything to distract him from the growing weight of his thoughts.

Then, one day, it happened. He sat in his car after work, staring blankly at the steering wheel. His chest felt heavy, his breaths shallow. It was like a thousand voices whispered in unison:

*“Be better. Be stronger. Don’t disappoint anyone.”*

Ryan gripped the wheel, his hands trembling. **Why wasn’t he enough?** He thought of all the expectations—the way he was supposed to look, act, and speak. He realized how much of his life was spent performing, fitting into a role that wasn’t his to play.

“I just want to be me,” he whispered. It was the first honest thing he had said in weeks.

## **The Power of Words**

Words are strange things, Ryan thought later. They can destroy someone without leaving a mark, or they can rebuild someone who’s falling apart.

He remembered what someone once told him: *“You always work so hard; I admire that about you.”* It wasn’t a big statement, but it stayed with him. Unlike criticism, it didn’t demand change. It acknowledged what he already was.

**What if the world said things differently?**

- Instead of *“You’re lazy,”* say, *“You’re so productive when you’re focused.”*
- Instead of *“Why don’t you speak up more?”* say, *“I love hearing your thoughts when you share them.”*
- Instead of *“Stop crying, be strong,”* say, *“It’s okay to feel this way. I’m here for you.”*

Words could either heal or harm, and Ryan realized how many wounds he carried from careless ones.

## **Choosing Peace**

Ryan knew he couldn’t change how the world treated him. But he could change how he treated himself. He started small:

- Letting himself rest without guilt.  
- Sharing how he felt with those he trusted.  
- Reminding himself that strength wasn’t about silence—it was about honesty.  

When someone criticized him, he reminded himself: *“It’s not what they say, it’s how I hear it.”* He learned to filter the noise, holding onto what helped him grow and letting go of what pulled him down.

And for those around him, he chose kindness in his words, because he understood their power. A simple, *“You did great today,”* or *“I appreciate you,”* could mean more than anyone realized.

Ryan still faced expectations. The world hadn’t changed. But he no longer let it destroy him. He chose peace—one thought, one word, and one day at a time.
