# The Fault Lines

### Perspective 1: **Anna**

Anna sat by the window, her hands trembling as she reread the email. It was from Mark—the man she had once trusted, admired, and loved. But now, his words felt like a slap to her face. It was all so *unfair*. 

She had always tried to support him, even when he was at his lowest. When he lost his job, when his father passed away, when his confidence seemed to crumble—Anna was there. She had put her own dreams on hold, sacrificing so much just to help him get back on his feet. Yet, it seemed like it was never enough. 

Mark had never truly appreciated what she did for him. And now, after everything she had done, after all the compromises she had made, he had the audacity to accuse her of being selfish. Of not understanding his needs. Of being too focused on her own ambitions to care about his.

Anna could barely hold back the tears as she read his final words: "I need space. I need someone who *really* understands me. You're just too... busy for me." 

Her heart broke. How could he not see the truth? How could he not see that she had given up everything for him? And now, to be blamed for *not caring*—it was too much.

"I never asked for much," she whispered to the empty room, "I just wanted him to see me."

### Perspective 2: **Mark**

Mark sat at his desk, staring at the same email he had sent earlier. He didn't regret a word of it, even though he knew it would hurt Anna. But sometimes, the truth was painful. 

For years, he had tried to make things work. He had tried to give Anna the space to pursue her dreams while supporting her in every way he could. But it had never been enough. She was always so wrapped up in her own ambitions, always busy with work, with projects, with her friends—there was never time for *him*. 

It wasn’t that he didn’t love her. He did, deeply. But he had started to feel like a ghost in her life, like an afterthought. It had been months since they had a real conversation. Every time he tried to talk to her about his feelings, she brushed him off, too busy or too tired to engage. She would smile, say all the right things, but then she’d disappear into her world again, leaving him feeling more and more invisible.

"I tried," he thought. "I really tried." But it was clear now—she just didn’t need him the way he needed her. 

The last straw came during their weekend getaway. Instead of spending time together, Anna had worked on her laptop the entire time, leaving Mark to wander the streets alone, wondering if he even mattered. 

He couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine when it wasn’t. She had *never* been there for him the way he had been there for her. The decision to send that email wasn’t easy, but it was necessary.

"I just need someone who can be there," he whispered, looking out at the empty streets below. "Is that too much to ask?"

### The Unraveling

Both Anna and Mark believed they had done everything right. Both had sacrificed, both had tried. Yet, both felt deeply wronged. 

Anna thought she had been the supportive partner, giving everything for the relationship. She had believed that if she just kept giving, eventually, Mark would see how much she cared. She had *tried* to balance her career and personal life, but somehow, it was never enough.

Mark, on the other hand, had felt abandoned. He believed that his emotional needs were being ignored, that no matter how hard he tried to support her, he was always left behind. He wanted her to see him, to make him a priority, but all she seemed to care about was her own success.

Their perspectives were equally compelling, equally painful. But neither one of them saw the other’s point of view—each locked in their own experience of hurt, each convinced they were the true victim of the other’s actions. 

And so, the rift between them grew. The love they once had was overshadowed by the fault lines they couldn’t see—or refused to see. They were two people, good and decent in their own right, but lost to each other in a sea of misunderstandings and unmet needs.
